# Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding


## Immediate management if shocked


- `Protect airway`
- keep `NBM` (nil by mouth)
- Insert two large-bore cannula (14–16G)
- Urgent bloods Tests `CBC`, `Urea`, `Creatinine`, `Electrolytes`, `Liver function test`, `Glucose`, `Clotting screen`
- `Crossmatch 4–6 units`
- Rapid `IV crystalloid infusion` up to 1L
- If signs of grade III or IV shock give `blood Group specific` or O `Rh –ve` until crossmatch done
- Otherwise continue IV fluids to maintain BP and transfuse if e.g. Hb <7
- Correct clotting abnormalities `Vitamin K`, `FFP`, `platelet concentrate`
- If risk of varices (e.g. known liver disease or alcohol excess), give `terlipressin` IV 1–2mg/6h and broad-spectrum IV `antibiotics`
- Consider referral to ICU,
- Consider `CVP` line to guide fluid replacement Aim for >5cmH2O
- CVP may mislead if there is ascites or CCF
- `Catheterize` and monitor urine output. Aim for >30mL/h
- Monitor `vital signs` every 15min until stable, then hourly
- Notify `surgeons` of all severe bleeds
- `Urgent endoscopy` for diagnosis ± control of bleeding at the earliest possible point after adequate resuscitation


## Management if hemodynamically stable

- Insert two large-bore IV cannula
- Take blood for `CBC`, `Urea`, `Creatinine`, `Electrolytes`, `Liver function test`, `Glucose`, `Clotting screen`, and `Bl. Group` & `save Bl. sample` for matching in case transfusion needed later.
- Give `IV fluids` to restore intravascular volume; avoid saline if cirrhotic/varices
- Consider a `CVP line` to monitor and guide fluid replacement
- Organize a `CXR`, `ECG`, and check `ABG`
- Consider a `urinary catheter` and monitor hourly urine output
- `Blood transfusion` if significant Hb drop (<70g/L)
- Correct clotting abnormalities (`vitamin K` , `FFP`, `platelets`)
- If suspicion of varices (e.g. known history of liver disease or alcohol excess)
- Then give `terlipressin` IV (1–2mg/6h for ≤3d)
- And initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g. `piperacillin`/`tazobactam` IV 4.5g/8h)
- Monitor `pulse`, `BP`, and `CVP` (keep >5cmH20) at least hourly until stable.
- Arrange an urgent `endoscopy`
- If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/embolization may be needed.
- For uncontrolled esophageal variceal bleeding, a `Sengstaken–Blakemore` tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by someone with experience.
- In patients who have undergone successful endoscopic hemostasis,
- Give PPI (e.g. `omeprazole` 40mg/12h IV/PO)
- And treat if positive for H. pylori

## Rebleeds

<mark> Serious event: 40% of patients who rebleed will die. </mark>

- Check vital signs every 15min 
- Call senior cover for repeat endoscopy and/or surgical intervention.
