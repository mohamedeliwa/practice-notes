# Myxedema coma

The ultimate hypothyroid state before death.

## Investigations

- `T3`, `T4`, `TSH`
- `CBC`
- `Urea` & `Creatinine` 
- `Electrolytes` (often ↓Na⁺), 
- `Cultures`
- `Bool Cortisol level` 
- `Glucose`
- `ABG` for PaO₂

## Management : Preferably on ICU

1. `High-flow O2` if cyanosed. 
2. `Ventilation` may be needed.
3. Correct any `hypoglycemia`.
4. Give `T3` (`liothyronine`) 5–20mcg/12h IV slowly. Be cautious: you may precipitate manifestations of ischemic heart disease. Alternative regimens involve `levothyroxine`.
5. Give `hydrocortisone` 100mg/8h IV—vital if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected (i.e. no goitre, no previous radioiodine, and no previous thyroid surgery).
6. If infection suspected, give `antibiotic`, e.g. `co-amoxiclav` 1.2g/8h IV.
7. `Caution with fluid`, rehydrate as needed but watch for cardiac dysfunction; BP may not respond to fluid and `inotropes` may be needed.
8. `Active warming` (blankets, fluids) may be needed for hypothermia. Beware complications (hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, arrhythmias).
9. **Further ℞**:
	1. `T3` 5–20mcg/4–12h IV until sustained improvement (~2–3d)
	2. then `levothyroxine` 50mcg/24h oral. 
	3. `Hydrocortisone` + IV fluids as needed (hyponatremia is dilutional).
