# Myxedema coma

The ultimate hypothyroid state before death.

Signs and symptoms: Looks hypothyroid (p220, p221, fi g 5.16); often >65yrs; hypothermia;
hyporefl exia; glucose; bradycardia; coma; seizures. May have had radioiodine,
thyroidectomy, or pituitary surgery (signs of hypopituitarism, p232). Psychosis (myxoedema
madness) may precede coma. Precipitants: infection, MI, stroke, or trauma.
Examination: Goitre; cyanosis; BP (cardiogenic); heart failure; signs of precipitants.
Treatment: Preferably on ICU.
• Blood for: T3, T4, TSH, FBC, U&E (often Na+), cultures, cortisol, glucose.
• ABG for PaO2. High-fl ow O2 if cyanosed. Ventilation may be needed.
• Correct any hypoglycaemia.
• Give T3 (liothyronine) 5–20mcg/12h IV slowly. Be cautious: you may precipitate manifestations
of ischaemic heart disease. Alternative regimens involve levothyroxine.
• Give hydrocortisone 100mg/8h IV—vital if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected (ie
no goitre, no previous radioiodine, and no previous thyroid surgery).
• If infection suspected, give antibiotic, eg co-amoxiclav 1.2g/8h IV.
• Caution with fl uid, rehydrate as needed but watch for cardiac dysfunction; BP may
not respond to fl uid and inotropes may be needed.
• Active warming (blankets, fl uids) may be needed for hypothermia. Beware complications
(hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, arrhythmias). See p848.
Further : T3 5–20mcg/4–12h IV until sustained improvement (~2–3d) then levothyroxine
50mcg/24h PO. Hydrocortisone + IV fl uids as needed (hyponatraemia is dilutional).
