# Broad complex tachycardia

<mark> If in doubt, treat as VT </mark>

## Management

- If Pulse not palpable, `treat as arrest`
- `Oxygen`: if SaO2<90% 
- `IV access`
- `ECG`
	- Connect to a `cardiac monitor` 
	- Have a `defibrillator` ready
- `CXR`
- Check for `Adverse signs`
	- Shock (e.g. BP <90mmHg, pulse >100)
	- Chest pain/ischemia on ECG
	- Heart failure
	- Syncope
- If at least one of Adverse signs exists (or hemodynamically unstable)
- `Sedation`
- Up to 3 `synchronized DC` shocks (120–150J for the first, then 150–360J subsequently*)
- Check and correct
	- `K+` : up to 60mmol `KCl` at 30mmol/h (via central line)
	- `Mg2+` : 4mL 50% `magnesium sulfate` over 30min (via central line)
	- `Ca2+`
- `Amiodarone` 300mg IV over more than 20min (via central line)
	- Peripherally only in emergency
	- Consider repeat shock
	- Then 900mg/24h IVI (via central line)
	- For refractory cases consider `procainamide` or `sotalol`.
- If `No Adverse signs` (hemodynamically stable)
- Correct electrolyte problems esp. low K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ (as above)
- If regular rhythm VT or uncertain rhythm give `amiodarone` (as above) `in progress...`
- If known history of SVT and BBB treat as for narrow complex tachycardia with e.g. `adenosine`
- `Amiodarone` 300mg IV over 20–60min (avoid if long QT) via central line.
- If irregular rhythm `Seek expert help`
	- Diagnosis is usually one of
		- AF with bundle branch block
		- Pre-excited AF: consider amiodarone
		- Polymorphic VT, e.g. torsade de pointes; give Mg2+ 2g IVI
- If no success or becomes unstable
- `Sedation`
- `Synchronized DC` shock
- After correction of VT
	- Establish the cause
	- Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give IV amiodarone infusion for 12–24h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic: sotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function).
	- Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) may help.
- Ventricular ﬁbrillation: Use `non-synchronized DC shock` (there is no R wave to trigger deﬁbrillation)
- If SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine
- Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics): These are the commonest post-MI arrhythmia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhythmic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.
- Torsade de pointes: 
	- if congenital treated by high doses of Beta-blockers.
	- If acquired long-QT syndromes: stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypokalemia, and give `magnesium sulfate` (2g IV over 10min).
		- Alternatives include: overdrive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or `isoprenaline` IVI to increase heart rate.
