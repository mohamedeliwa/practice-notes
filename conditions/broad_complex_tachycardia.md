# Broad complex tachycardia

ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complexes >120ms (>3 small squares).

Differential diagnosis : Ventricular tachycardia (VT) including torsade de pointes, SVT with aberrant conduction, e.g. AF or atrial flutter, with bundle branch block. Pre-excited tachycardias, e.g. AF, atrial flutter, or AV re-entry tachycardia, with underlying WPW.

## Management

- If Pulse not palpable, `treat as arrest`
- `Oxygen`: if SaO2<90% 
- `IV access`
- `ECG`
	- Connect to a `cardiac monitor` 
	- Have a `defibrillator` ready
- `CXR`
- Check for `Adverse signs`
	- Shock (e.g. BP <90mmHg, pulse >100)
	- Chest pain/ischemia on ECG
	- Heart failure
	- Syncope
- If at least one of Adverse signs exists (or hemodynamically unstable)
- `Sedation`
- Up to 3 `synchronized DC` shocks (120–150J for the first, then 150–360J subsequently*)
- Check and correct
	- `K+` : up to 60mmol `KCl` at 30mmol/h (via central line)
	- `Mg2+` : 4mL 50% `magnesium sulfate` over 30min (via central line)
	- `Ca2+`
- `Amiodarone` 300mg IV over more than 20min (via central line)
	- Peripherally only in emergency
	- Consider repeat shock
	- Then 900mg/24h IVI (via central line)
	- For refractory cases consider `procainamide` or `sotalol`.
- If `No Adverse signs` (hemodynamically stable)
- Correct electrolyte problems esp. low K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ (as above)
- If regular rhythm VT or uncertain rhythm give `amiodarone` (as above) (avoid if long QT) 
- If known history of SVT and BBB treat as for narrow complex tachycardia with e.g. `adenosine`
- If irregular rhythm `Seek expert help`
	- Diagnosis is usually one of
		- AF with bundle branch block
		- Pre-excited AF: consider amiodarone
		- Polymorphic VT, e.g. torsade de pointes; give Mg2+ 2g IVI
- If no success or becomes unstable
- `Sedation`
- `Synchronized DC` shock
- After correction of VT
	- Establish the cause
	- Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy.
	- If VT occurs after MI, give IV `amiodarone` infusion for 12–24h;
	- If 24h after MI, also start `oral` anti-arrhythmic: `sotalol` (if good LV function) or `amiodarone` (if poor LV function).
	- Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD).
## Special Conditions

- `Ventricular ﬁbrillation`: Use `non-synchronized DC shock` (there is no R wave to trigger deﬁbrillation)
- `SVT with aberrant conduction`: Manage as SVT with e.g. `adenosine`
- `Ventricular extrasystoles` (ectopics): Patients with frequent ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that anti-dysrhythmic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.
- `Torsade de pointes`: 
	- If `congenital`: treated by high doses of Beta-blockers.
	- If `acquired`: long-QT syndromes:
	- Stop all predisposing drugs
	- Correct hypokalemia
	- `Magnesium sulfate` (2g IV over 10min).
	- Alternatives include: overdrive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or `isoprenaline` IVI to increase heart rate.
