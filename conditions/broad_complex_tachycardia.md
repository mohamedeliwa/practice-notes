# Broad complex tachycardia

<mark> If in doubt, treat as VT </mark>

## Management

- Connect patient to a cardiac monitor and have a defibrillator to hand.
- Monitor O2 sats and if <90% give supplemental oxygen.
- Correct electrolyte abnormalities, esp K+ and Mg2+.
- Check for adverse signs. Low cardiac output (clammy, reduced consciousness, BP <90); oliguria; angina; pulmonary oedema.
- Obtain 12-lead ECG (request CXR) and obtain IV access.
- If hemodynamically unstable VT
	- <mark> Synchronized DC shock </mark>
	- Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h, and 4mL 50% magnesium sulfate over 30min both via central line.
	- Follow with amiodarone 300mg IV over 10–20min (peripherally only in emergency).
	- For refractory cases consider procainamide or sotalol.
- f hemodynamically stable VT
	- Correct hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: as above.
	- `Amiodarone` 300mg IV over 20–60min (avoid if long QT) via central line.
	- If this fails, use synchronized `DC shock`
- After correction of VT
	- Establish the cause
	- Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give IV amiodarone infusion for 12–24h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic: sotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function).
	- Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD) may help.
- Ventricular ﬁbrillation: Use `non-synchronized DC shock` (there is no R wave to trigger deﬁbrillation)
- If SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine
- Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics): These are the commonest post-MI arrhythmia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhythmic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.
- Torsade de pointes: 
	- if congenital treated by high doses of Beta-blockers.
	- If acquired long-QT syndromes: stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypokalaemia, and give `magnesium sulfate` (2g IV over 10min).
		- Alternatives include: overdrive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or `isoprenaline` IVI to increase heart rate.
