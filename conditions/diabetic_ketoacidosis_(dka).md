# Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

---

Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway used in starvation states; it is far less efficient than normal pathway, and produces acetone as a byproduct (hence the fruity breath of patients in ketosis). 

In acute diabetic ketoacidosis, the body cannot use glucose effectively due to a lack of insulin, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where ketoacidosis is the only mechanism of energy production. 
This results in **hyperglycemia**, **ketoacidosis**, and **dehydration**, which can be life-threatening if untreated.

### **Diagnosis Criteria:**

1. **Acidaemia:** Venous blood pH <7.3 or **HCO3-** < 15.0 mmol/L.
2. **Hyperglycemia:** Blood glucose >11.0 mmol/L or known DM.
3. **Ketonaemia:** Blood ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L or significant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick).

**Tests to Perform:**

- **ECG**, **CXR**
- **Urine tests:** Dipstick, MSU (urine culture)
- **Blood tests:**
    - Capillary and lab glucose
    - Ketones
    - pH (venous blood, ABG if GCS or hypoxia)
    - U&E, HCO3-, osmolality, FBC, blood culture

---

### **Severe DKA (Consider HDU/ICU Transfer):**

- **Blood ketones >6 mmol/L**
- **O2 sats <92%** on air
- **Venous bicarbonate <5 mmol/L**
- **Venous/arterial pH <7.0**
- **Systolic BP <90 mmHg**
- **K <3.5 mmol/L**
- **Pulse >100 or <60 bpm**
- **GCS <12**

### **Management Algorithm:**

4. **Volume Replacement:**
    
    - Initially, **fluid resuscitation** to correct dehydration.
5. **Correct Metabolic Defects:**
    
    - **Insulin infusion** to reduce blood glucose and ketones.
    - Start with **0.1 U/kg/hr** of regular insulin IV and adjust as needed.
    - When glucose drops to **<15 mmol/L**, add **glucose 10% IV** to maintain blood glucose at **6-10 mmol/L**.
6. **Electrolyte Monitoring and Replacement:**
    
    - **Potassium (K):** Be cautious of hypokalemia. If K <3.5 mmol/L, hold insulin and give potassium replacement.
    - **Sodium (Na):** Watch for hyponatremia and correct as needed. Corrected Na+ = Na+ + 2.4 * [(glucose - 5.5) / 5.5].
7. **Monitor pH and Ketones:**
    
    - Continue insulin until blood ketones <0.6 mmol/L and pH >7.3.

### **Pitfalls:**

- **Plasma glucose** may not be very high if insulin is continued.
- **WBC count** can be elevated even without infection.
- **Hyponatremia** is common due to osmolar compensation; corrected Na+ should be calculated.
- **Ketonuria** does not always indicate ketoacidosis—check blood ketones.
- **Recurrent DKA** can occur if insulin is stopped prematurely, before ketones clear.
- **Non-diabetic causes of acidosis** (e.g., aspirin overdose, lactic acidosis) should be considered if glucose is normal.

### **Complications:**

- **Cerebral oedema**: Seek help if there is sudden CNS decline.
- **Aspiration pneumonia**
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia.
- **Thromboembolism**

---

### **Prevention:**

- Educate patients on **insulin compliance** and recognizing **triggering factors**. Regular follow-ups and better control of diabetes can reduce the risk of DKA.
