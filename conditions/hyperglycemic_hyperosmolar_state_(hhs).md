# Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)

---

Seen in unwell patients with type 2 DM.\
The **history is longer (e.g. 1wk)** with marked dehydration and **glucose >540 mg/dL**.\
There is no switch to ketone metabolism, so **ketonemia stays <3mmol/L** and **pH >7.3**.\
**Osmolality is typically >320mosmol/kg**.

## Management

 1. Give `LMWH` prophylaxis to all unless contraindication
	 - Occlusive events are a danger (focal CNS signs, chorea, DIC, leg ischemia/rhabdomyolysis)
 2. Rehydrate slowly with `0.9% saline` IVI over 48h
	  - Typical deficits are **110–220mL/kg**, i.e. 8–15L for a 70kg adult. 
 3. Replace `K⁺` when urine starts to flow (see DKA article for k⁺ replacement).
 4. Only use `insulin` if blood glucose not falling by 90 mg/dL/h with rehydration or if ketonemia
	 - Start slowly **0.05u/kg/h**.
	 - Keep blood glucose at least **180–270 mg/dL** for first 24 hours to avoid cerebral oedema. 
 5. Look for the cause, e.g. MI, drugs, sepsis, or bowel infarct.
