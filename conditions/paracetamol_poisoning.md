# Paracetamol poisoning

<mark> 12g (=24 tablets) or 150mg/kg in adults may be fatal. </mark>

<mark> If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill. </mark>

If the patient weighs >110kg, calculate ingested dose using <mark>a body weight of 110kg </mark> to avoid underestimating toxicity.

## **Investigations**

- `Glucose` 
- `Urea`, `Creatinine` 
- `Electrolytes`
- `Liver Function Tests`
- `INR` 
- `ABG`
- `CBC`
- `HCO3`
- `Blood paracetamol level` at 4h post-ingestion.

## **Management**

1. General measures: (See Acute poisoning article—general measures). 
2. GI decontamination is recommended in those presenting <4h after overdose: give `activated charcoal` 1g/kg (max 50g).
3.  If <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting start `acetylcysteine`.
4. If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and start `acetylcysteine`, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal.
5. If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from ingestion, treatment may still help. (Get advice).
6. **Acetylcysteine** is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/kg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. 
7. Rash is a common SE: treat with `chlorphenamine` + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid reaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). 
8. An alternative (if acetylcysteine unavailable) is `methionine` 2.5g/4h oral for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is unreliable if vomiting.

## **Ongoing management**

- Next day do `INR`, Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes, Liver Function Tests. 
- If INR rising, continue `acetylcysteine` until <1.4.
- If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don’t hesitate to get help.
- Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by e.g. King’s College criteria.


### King’s College Hospital criteria in paracetamol-induced acute liver failure

- Arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion

Or all of the following

- Prothrombin time (PT) >100s
- Creatinine 3.4 mg/dL
- Grade III or IV encephalopathy.

Fulfilling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure
