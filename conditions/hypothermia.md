# **Hypothermia**


Have a high index of suspicion and a low-reading thermometer.\
<mark> Most patients are elderly and do not complain of, or feel, cold </mark> —so they have not tried to warm up.\
In the young, hypothermia is usually from cold exposure (e.g. near-drowning), or is
secondary to impaired consciousness (e.g. following excess alcohol or drug overdose).

**Definition** Hypothermia means a core (rectal) temperature <35°C.

## **Investigations**

- Check oral or axillary `T°`. 
- If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5°C, use a low-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35°C? Infra-red ear thermometers can accurately reflect core temperature.
-  Urgent Urea & Creatinine 
- `Electrolytes`
- `Plasma glucose` 
- `Amylase`
- `Thyroid function tests` 
- `CBC`
- `Blood cultures`
- Consider `blood gases`
- `ECG` may show J-waves


## **Treatment**

1. ABCDE, but don’t expose to cold.
2. All patients should receive `warm, humidified O2`; 
3. `Ventilate` if comatose or respiratory insufficiency
4. Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of ½°C/h using blankets or active external warming (hot air duvets). If T° rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid rewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. <mark>A falling BP can be a sign of too rapid warming</mark>.
5. Check temperature, BP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min 
6. Warm IVI
7. `Cardiac monitor` is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming or on stimulation)
8. Consider `antibiotics` for the prevention of pneumonia. Give these routinely in patients over 65yrs with T° <32°C
9. Consider `urinary catheter` (to monitor renal function)

> [!Note] **Sudden Hypothermia**
> 
>  In **sudden hypothermia** from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovascular Instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. 
>  
>  Options include warmed fluid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal) and intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). 
>  
>  In the event of cardiac arrest, defibrillation is usually unsuccessful if T° <30°C (consider amiodarone, bretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C.
