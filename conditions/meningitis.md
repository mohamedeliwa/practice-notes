# Meningitis

key points in management of suspected bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis

<mark> If a non-blanching rash is present, give benzylpenicillin 1.2g IM/IV before admitting. </mark>

<mark> investigations and treatment proceed in parallel. </mark>

> If suspect `viral` encephalitis see `Encephalitis` article
## Investigations

- Perform `LP` 
	- without waiting for `CT` (not if GCS ≤12 or focal neurology). 
	- Wait for `clotting screen` only if suspect coagulopathy. 
	- Record opening pressure: 7–18cm CSF normal but increased in meningitis.
	- Send CSF for `MC&S`, `protein`, `lactate`, `glucose`, `virology`/`PCR`.
- `Urea`, `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`,
- `CBC` (low WBC ≈ immunocompromise: get help)
- `LFT`
- `Glucose`
- `Coagulation`
- `Throat swabs` (1 for bacteria, 1 for virology).
- `CXR`.
- Consider `HIV`, `TB` tests.
## Management

- ABCs: `IVI + fluid resus`. Check and correct `blood glucose`
### If Meningitic: (e.g. neck stiffness; photophobia) without shock

- Take `blood cultures`
- **If Signs of increased ICP/shift of brain** (papilledema, uncontrolled seizures, focal neurology, GCS ≤12)
- Get `ICU` help
- `IV antibiotics` (see below)
- `Dexamethasone` 10mg/6h IV
- `Airway support`
- `Fluid resuscitation`
- `Delay LP` until stable
- Nurse at 30°
- **If No Signs of increased ICP/shift of brain**
- Get senior help
- Perform `LP` ≤1h
- `IV antibiotics` (pre-LP, if LP delayed >1h) (see below)
- `Dexamethasone` 10mg/6h IV

### If Septicemic: e.g. shock (prolonged capillary refill time; cold hands + feet; increased BP), evolving rash

- Get `ICU` help
- Take `blood cultures`
- `IV antibiotics` (see below)
- `Airway support` /pre-emptive intubation
- `Fluid resuscitation`/`ionotropes`/`vasopressors` (aim for: MAP >70mmHg; urine output >30mL/h)
- Delay `LP` until stable

### Careful monitoring in both cases

Subsequent therapy: Discuss `antibiotic` (see below) therapy with microbiology and adjust
based on organism and local sensitivities. Maintain normovolemia with IVI if
needed. `Isolate` for 1st 24h. Inform Public Health.

### Antibiotics

- **Initiate early `antibiotics`**. 
- Take `blood cultures` first. Then perform `LP` **prior to antibiotics** only in patients where no evidence of shock, petechial rash or increased ICP and where able to obtain LP within 1h. 
- Empirical options include `ceftriaxone` 2g/12h IV; add e.g. `amoxicillin` 2g/4h IV if >60yrs age or immunocompromised.

### Prophylaxis

- Discuss with public health/ID
- Household contacts in droplet range
- Those who have kissed the patient’s mouth. Give `ciprofloxacin` (500mg oral, 1 dose; child 5–12yrs: 250mg; child <5yrs: 30mg/kg to max 125mg)
