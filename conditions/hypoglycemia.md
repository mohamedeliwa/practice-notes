# Hypoglycemia


## Management

 - If **conscious, orientated, and able to swallow**
	 - Give 15–20g of quick-acting carbohydrate snack (e.g. 200mL orange juice)
	 - Recheck blood glucose after 10–15mins (repeat snack up to 3 times). 
  - If **conscious but uncooperative**
	  - squirt glucose gel between teeth and gums. 
  - If **unconscious patients**, or those **not responding to these measures**
	  - Start `glucose IVI` (e.g. 10% at 200mL/h if conscious; 10% at 200mL/15mins if unconscious)
	  - Or give `glucagon` 1mg IV/IM (will not work in malnourished patients). 
	  - Expect prompt recovery 
	  - Once blood glucose >4.0mmol/L and patient has recovered, give long-acting carbohydrate (e.g. slice of toast).
