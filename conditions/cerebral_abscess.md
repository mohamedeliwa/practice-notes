# Cerebral abscess

Suspect this in any patient with increased ICP, especially if there is fever or increased TLC.
It may follow ear, sinus, dental, or periodontal infection; skull fracture; congenital heart disease; endocarditis; bronchiectasis. It may also occur in the absence of systemic signs of inflammation.

## Investigations

- `CT`/`MRI` (e.g. ‘ring-enhancing’ lesion)
- `CBC` 
- `ESR`
- `Biopsy`

## Treatment

- Urgent neurosurgical referral
- Treat increased ICP (see ICP article)
- If frontal sinuses or teeth are the source, the likely organism will be Strep. milleri (microaerophilic), or oropharyngeal anaerobes. 
- In ear abscesses: B. fragilis or other anaerobes are most common. 
- Bacterial abscesses are often peripheral 
- toxoplasma lesions are deeper (e.g. basal ganglia). 
-  If immunocompromised, Discuss with infectious diseases/microbiology.
