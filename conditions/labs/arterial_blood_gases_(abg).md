## A simple method

1. Look at the pH, is there an acidosis or alkalosis?

   - pH <7.35 is an acidosis; pH >7.45 is an alkalosis.

2. Is the CO₂ abnormal?  
   If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?

   - Is CO₂ raised with an acidosis, lowered with an alkalosis?  
     If so, it is in keeping with the pH and thus caused by a respiratory problem. If
     there is no change, or an opposite one, then the change is compensatory.

3. Is the HCO₃⁻ abnormal? (Normal concentration 22–28mmol/L.)  
   If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?

   - Is HCO₃⁻ raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis?  
     If so, the problem is a metabolic one.

4. Is the PaO₂ abnormal? Interpret in the context of the FiO₂. `see below`

## Assessment of acid base status:

- **_Step 1_**: Acidemic or Alkalemic? `see above`
- **_Step 2_**: Is the primary disturbance respiratory or metabolic? `see above`
- **_Step 3_**: Is the respiratory disturbance acute or chronic?
  - In acute respiratory disturbances → PaO₂ variation by `10 mmHg` is accompanied by a pH shift of `0.08 units`.
  - In chronic respiratory disturbances (renal compensation) → PaO₂ variation of `10 mmHg` is accompanied by a pH shift of only `0.03 units`.
- **_Step 4_**: For a metabolic acidosis, is there an increased anion gap?
  - `Anion GAP AG = (Na⁺ + K⁺) – (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻)`
  - Normal 12mmol/L (range: 10–18mmol/L).
- **_Step 5_**: Are there other metabolic processes present in a patient with an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis?
  - `Corrected HCO₃⁻ = Measured HCO₃⁻ + (anion gap - 12)`
  - Normal corrected bicarbonate (24) → Pure anion gap acidosis.
  - Below normal corrected bicarbonate → Additional metabolic acidosis.
  - Above normal corrected bicarbonate → Associated metabolic alkalosis.
- **_Step 6_**: Is the respiratory system compensating adequately for a metabolic disturbance?
  - This step is only necessary if there is a primary metabolic disturbance
  - `Expected PaO₂ = [1.5 x  HCO₃⁻] + 8 ± 2`
  - If the measured PaO₂ is greater than the expected PaO₂, then The respiratory system is not compensating for the metabolic acidosis
  - A respiratory acidosis is also present.
  - PaCO₂ increases `0.6` mmHg per `1 mEq/L` rise in HCO₃⁻
  - The respiratory system rarely reacts by retaining CO₂ to a pressure greater than `50-55 mmHg`.
  - A value greater than that suggests an abnormal (i.e. primary) respiratory acidosis.

## Assessment of Oxygenation Status:

- Patient is hypoxemic or not?
  - `PaO₂ < 80mmHg` (on room air) = Hypoxemia.
  - Acceptable lower limits for PaO₂ for age = `100 - (1/3 * age)`
- Level of hypoxemia.
  - Mild → PaO₂ 60-79 mmHg
  - Moderate (RF) → PaO₂ 40-59 mmHg
  - Sever (RF) → PaO₂ < 40 mmHg
  - `PaO₂ < 60mmHg` (8 kPa) or `PaCO₂ > 49 mmHg` (6.5 kPa) = respiratory failure
- PaCO₂ level?
  - Hypercapnia or Eucapnia or Hypocapnia.
  - Type I or type II RF or just respiratory insufficiency or normal.
- Level of correction if Patient on FiO₂ more than 21%.
  - Corrected hypoxemia → PaO₂ between minimal acceptable level and 100mmHg (80-120 mmHg)
  - Excessively corrected hypoxemia → PaO₂ greater than 120 mmHg
  - Uncorrected hypoxemia → PaO₂ < acceptable level (↓ 80 mmHg)
- Calculate A-a Gradient
  - A-a gradient on room air = `[150 - 1.25 * PaCO₂] - PaO₂`
  - A-a gradient on oxygen = `[(FiO₂ * 713) - (1.25 * PaCO₂)] - PaO₂`
  - Normal: 10-20
  - Hypoxemia With normal AaDO₂DD → all causes of Alveolar Hypoventilation
  - Hypoxemia With widened/high AaDO₂DD → Shunt, or V/Q mismatch, or Diffusion defect

## Causes of metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap:

- Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia).
- Urate (renal failure).
- Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol).
- Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol).

## Causes of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap:

- Renal tubular acidosis.
- Diarrhoea.
- Drugs (acetazolamide).
- Addison’s disease.
- Pancreatic fi stula.
- Ammonium chloride ingestion.

## Causes of Metabolic alkalosis:

- Vomiting.
- K⁺ depletion (diuretics).
- Burns.
- Ingestion of base.

## Causes of Respiratory acidosis:

- Type II respiratory failure due to any lung, neuromuscular, or physical cause.
- Most commonly COPD. Look at the PaO₂. It will probably be low. Is oxygen therapy required? Use controlled O2 (Venturi connector) if COPD is the underlying cause, as too much oxygen may make matters worse.
- `Beware exhaustion` in asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema, which can present with this picture when close to respiratory arrest. A normal or high PaCO₂ is worrying. These patients require urgent ITU review for ventilatory support.

## Causes of Respiratory alkalosis:

- A result of hyperventilation of any cause. CNS causes: Stroke; subarachnoid bleed; meningitis.
- Others: Mild/moderate asthma; anxiety; altitude; ↑ T°; pregnancy; pulmonary emboli (reflex hyperventilation); drugs, eg salicylates.
