# **Acute poisoning**

## **Investigations**

- `Glucose`
- `Urea` & `Creatinine` 
- `Electrolytes`
- `CBC`
- `LFT`
- `INR`
- `ABG` 
- `ECG`
- `Paracetamol`, and `salicylate` levels
- `Urine/serum toxicology`
- Speciﬁc assays as appropriate

## **Emergency Management** (general measures)

1. `ABC`
2. `Clear airway`
3. `Consider ventilation` (if the respiratory rate is <8/min, or PaO₂ <60mmHg, when breathing 60% O₂, or the airway is at risk, e.g. GCS ≤ 8)
4. Treat shock (see shock article)
5. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone

## Further Management

6. Assess the patient
7. `History` from patient, friends, or family is vital
8. Features from the examination may help
9. Do Investigations
10. Monitor: T°, pulse, and respiratory rate, BP, O₂ saturations, urine output ± ECG 
11. Supportive measures: may need catheterization
12. ↓Absorption: consider gastric lavage ± activated charcoal (see below)
13. Speciﬁc measures (see below)
14. For antidotes (see below)
15. Consider `naloxone` if ↓conscious level and pin-point pupils 
16. Consider Vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and glucose if drowsy/confused

## **Speciﬁc Points**

**Plasma Toxicology**: 
- For all unconscious patients, measure `paracetamol`, `aspirin`, and `blood glucose` levels.
- Additional tests may be required based on the suspected drug, with common ones including `digoxin`, `methanol`, `lithium`, `iron`, and `theophylline`. 
- `Urine screening` for recreational drugs may be helpful in some cases.

**GI Decontamination**: 
- `Activated charcoal` is preferred over `gastric lavage` for many drug poisonings.

**Activated Charcoal**: 
- Reduces drug absorption from the gut when given as a `single dose of 50g` with water, especially for drugs like `salicylates` and `paracetamol`. 
- It's given in `repeated doses (50g/4h)` to increase elimination of some drugs from the blood, e.g. `carbamazepine`, `dapsone`, `theophyllines`, `quinine`, `phenobarbital`, and `paraquat`.
- Lower doses are used in children
- Avoid use with `petroleum`, `corrosives`, `alcohols`, `clofenotane`, `malathion` and `metal salts`(e.g. iron, lithium).

**Gastric Lavage**: Rarely recommended. Avoid it if petroleum, corrosives, or if the patient is unconscious. Only proceed if advised by Toxbase or Poisons Information Service.

**Procedure for Gastric Lavage**: 
- Rarely used
- Lavage after 30–60min may make matters worse
- <mark>Do not empty stomach if </mark>
	- Petroleum products
	- Corrosives such as acids, alkalis, bleach, descalers have been ingested (exception: paraquat), 
	- Patient is unconscious or unable to protect their airway (unless intubated)
- <mark> Never induce vomiting. </mark>

**Gastric emptying and lavage Process**

1. If comatose, or no gag reflex, protect airway with cuffed endotracheal tube. 
2. If conscious, get verbal consent.
3. Monitor O₂ sat.
4. Have suction apparatus to hand and working
5. Position the patient in left lateral position.
6. Raise the foot of the bed by 20cm.
7. Pass a lubricated tube (14mm external diameter) via the mouth, asking the patient to swallow.
8. Confirm position in stomach
9. Drain the gastric contents.
10. Check pH with litmus paper.
11. Perform gastric lavage using 300–600mL tepid water at a time. 
12. Massage the left hypochondrium then drain fluid.
13. Repeat until no tablets in drained fluid.
14. Leave `activated charcoal` (50g in 200mL water) in the stomach unless alcohol, iron, Li+, or ethylene glycol ingested.
15. When pulling out tube, occlude its end (prevents aspiration of fluid remaining in the tube).


**Hemodialysis**: 
- May be necessary for poisoning from `ethylene glycol`, `lithium`, `methanol`, `phenobarbital`, `salicylates`, and `sodium valproate`.


## **Some specific poisons and their antidotes**

**Benzodiazepines** 
- `Flumazenil` (for respiratory arrest) 200mcg over 15s; then 100mcg at 60s intervals if needed. 
- Usual dose range: 300–600mcg IV over 3–6min (up to 1mg; 2mg if on ICU). 
- May provoke fits. Use only after expert advice.

**Beta-blockers**
- Try `atropine` up to 3mg IV. 
- If atropine fails
- Give `glucagon` 2–10mg IV bolus + 5% glucose  then infusion of 50mcg/kg/h. 
- Also consider including `phosphodiesterase inhibitor` infusions (e.g. enoximone 5–20mcg/kg/min). 
- If unresponsive, consider `pacing`.

**Cyanide**

- `100% O₂`
- `GI decontamination`
- If mild, supportive care is usually sufficient. 
- If moderate/severe then specific treatment to bind cyanide is required. 
- Give `sodium nitrite`/`sodium thiosulfate`, or `dicobalt edetate` 300mg IV over 1min, then 50mL 50% `glucose` IV (repeat once if no response after a minute); 
- or `hydroxocobalamin`  5g over 15min repeated once if required. 
- Get expert help.

**Carbon monoxide**
