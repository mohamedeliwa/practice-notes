# Acute poisoning

## Investigations

- `Glucose`
- `Urea` & `Creatinine` 
- `Electrolytes`
- `CBC`
- `LFT`
- `INR`
- `ABG` 
- `ECG`
- `Paracetamol`, and `salicylate` levels
- `Urine/serum toxicology`
- Speciﬁc assays as appropriate

## Emergency Management (general measures)

1. `ABC`
2. `Clear airway`
3. `Consider ventilation` (if the respiratory rate is <8/min, or PaO₂ <60mmHg, when breathing 60% O₂, or the airway is at risk, e.g. GCS ≤ 8)
4. Treat shock (see shock article)
5. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone

## Further Management

6. Assess the patient
7. `History` from patient, friends, or family is vital
8. Features from the examination may help
9. Do Investigations
10. Monitor: T°, pulse, and respiratory rate, BP, O₂ saturations, urine output ± ECG 
11. Supportive measures: may need catheterization
12. ↓Absorption: consider gastric lavage ± activated charcoal
13. Speciﬁc measures (see below)
14. For antidotes (see below)
15. Consider `naloxone` if ↓conscious level and pin-point pupils 
16. Consider Vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and glucose if drowsy/confused
