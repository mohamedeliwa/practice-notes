# Sepsis (Septic shock)

Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

Septic shock is Sepsis in combination with:
- EITHER `lactate >2mmol/L` despite adequate fluid resuscitation
- OR the patient is requiring `vasopressors` to maintain MAP ≥65mmHg.

## Acute management of sepsis in adults
## Assessment 

- `ABCDE` : with shock we are dealing primarily with `C`
- 2 large-bore `IV access`
- `ECG`: for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischemia
- General review: 
	- `Capillary refill time`
	- `Mottled/ashen skin`
	- `Conscious level`
- Localize `source of infection`: don’t forget to assess wounds/ulcers which may be hidden.

<mark>If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.</mark>

## Investigations

### Blood tests

- Serial `ABG`s or `VBG`s for lactate
- `Blood cultures`
- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`
- `CRP`
- `CBC`
- `Liver function tests`
- `Clotting screen`
### Samples

- `Sputum` and `urine` for C&S
- Swab any `wounds`
- Consider `LP`
- Fluid from `drains` and `lines`
- `Joint` aspirates
- `Ascitic` tap

### Imaging

- `CXR`
- Consider `CT`/ `US` / `MRI` / `echo` of suspected source

## Treatment

- Broad spectrum `antibiotics` and start within 1h 
	- Consider covering non-bacterial microbes, (e.g  `Acyclovir` if HSV encephalitis is suspected)
- Fluids: Give within 1h if high risk with `SBP <90`, `AKI`, or `lactate >2` (consider if <2).
	- 500mL boluses `0.9% saline` over 15mins. Caution in heart failure.
	- If no improvement after 2 boluses, consider referral to ICU.
- `Oxygen`:  target saturations are 94–98% (or 88–92% if at risk of CO2 retention, eg COPD).
- `Surgical` involvement: Eg emergency wound debridement.
- Manage acute complications: `Shock`, `AKI`, `DIC`, `ARDS`, `arrhythmias` (may spontaneously resolve when sepsis improves).
- Consider `ICU`  if after 1h of antibiotics and fluids still:
	- SBP <90
	- RR >30
	- Reduced GCS
	- Raised lactate not reduced by >20%


> MAP = mean arterial pressure.\
> MAP = cardiac output (CO) x systemic vascular resistance (SVR).\
> CO = stroke volume x heart rate.\
> Shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both.\
