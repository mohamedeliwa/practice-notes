# **Burns**


## **Assessment**

**Burn size**: 

- The `rule of nines` (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk 18%; perineum 1%).
- Ignore erythema

**Burn depth**:

- Assessing this can be hard. 
- The big distinction is whether the burn is `partial thickness` (painful, red, and blistered) or `full thickness` (insensate/ painless; grey-white). 
- NB: burns can `evolve`, particularly over the first 48h.

## **Resuscitation**

1. Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major burns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children).
2. Assess site, size, and depth of burn, to help calculate fluid requirements
3. Referral is still needed in cases of
	- Full thickness burns >5%
	- Partial thickness burns >10% in adults or >5% in children or the elderly 
	- Burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns, and burns with inhalational injury.
4. **Airway**
	- Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if `hot gases` inhaled
	- Consider early `intubation`
	- Obstruction can develop in the first 24h
5. **Breathing**
	- Consider `escharotomy` if chest burns are impairing thorax expansion and normal movement.
	- Give `100% O₂`
	- Suspect `carbon monoxide poisoning` (see acute poisoning article) from history, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhemoglobin level (COHb)
	- Consider `hyperbaric O₂` if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; >25% COHb or >20% if pregnant.
	- SpO2 (oximetry) is unreliable in CO poisoning.
6. **Circulation**
	- Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require `IV fluid resuscitation`.
	- Put up `2 large-bore IV lines`  (14G or 16G)
	- Do not worry if you have to put these through burned skin
	- `Intraosseous access` is valuable in infants and can be used in adults
	- `Secure them` well: they are literally lifelines.
	- **Fluid Replacement**
		- use Parkland formula : `4 * weight (kg) * % of burn = mL Hartmann’s solution in 24h`, half given in 1st 8h.
		- Replace fluid from the time of burn, not from the time first seen in hospital
		- Formulae are only guides: adjust IVI according to `clinical response` and `urine output`
		- `Urine output aim` is 0.5mL/kg/h (1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury
		- Monitor T° (core and surface);
		- Catheterize the bladder
		- Beware of over-resuscitation which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.

## **Treatment**

1. `Cool the burn, warm the patient,` Do not apply cold water to extensive burns for long periods: this may intensify shock. 
2. Take care with circumferential full thickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particularly after fluid resuscitation. Decompress (`escharotomy` and `fasciotomy`) as needed. 
3. If transferring to a burns unit, **DO NOT** burst blisters or apply any special creams as this can hinder assessment. 
4. Simple `saline gauze` or `paraffin gauze` is suitable; `cling film` is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. 
5. `Titrate morphine` IV for good analgesia. 
6. Ensure `tetanus immunity`. 
7. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used.


## **Definitive dressings** 

- **Partial thickness burns**, e.g. biological (pigskin, cadaveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadiazine cream alone or with cerium nitrate; it forms a leathery eschar which resists infection. 
- **Major full-thickness burns** benefit from early tangential excision and split skin grafts as the burn is a major source of inflammatory cytokines and forms a rich medium for bacterial growth.
