# Pheochromocytoma emergencies

Patients with pheochromocytoma may have had undiagnosed symptoms for some
time, but stress, abdominal palpation, parturition, general anaesthetic, or contrast
media used in imaging can cause acute hypertensive crises.

## Management 

Take to `ICU`

Principle is combined **α- and β-adrenoreceptor blockade**, but α must be started ﬁrst,
as unopposed β-blockade can worsen hypertension.

1. Start with `short-acting, IV α-blocker`, e.g. `phentolamine` 2–5mg IV. 
	- Repeat to maintain safe BP.
2. When BP controlled, give `long-acting α-blocker`, e.g. `phenoxybenzamine` 10mg/24h oral (increase by 10mg/d as needed, up to 30mg/12h oral) 
	- Alternative is `α1-selective blockers`, e.g. `doxazosin`, are preferred in some centers, particularly if surgery is not an option, e.g. metastatic tumor.
3. A `β1-blocker` may also be given at this stage to control any tachycardia or myocardial ischaemia/dysrhythmias.
4. Surgery is usually done electively after 4–6wks to allow full α-blockade and volume expansion. When admitted for surgery the `phenoxybenzamine` dose is increased until signiﬁcant postural hypotension occurs.
