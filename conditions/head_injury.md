# Head Injury

<mark> If the pupils are unequal, </mark> diagnose rising intracranial pressure (ICP), e.g. from extradural
hemorrhage, and summon urgent neurosurgical help.

Retinal vein pulsation at `fundoscopy` helps exclude increased ICP.

## Investigations

- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`
- `Glucose`
- `CBC`
- `Blood Alcohol`
- `Toxicology screen`
- `ABGs`
- `Clotting`

## Management

1. **Initial Priority:**
	
	- <mark> Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation </mark>(ABC) remains the 1st priority. 
	- Oxygen if sat < 92%
	- Intubate and hyperventilate if necessary
	- `Immobilize neck` until injury to cervical spine excluded
	- `Treat for shock` if required, stop bleeding and support circulation
	- Treat seizures with `lorazepam` and/or `phenytoin` (see status epilepticus article)
	- Assess level of consciousness (GCS)
	- <mark> If GCS ≤8 </mark> then seek urgent anesthetic and ICU help to protect airway. 
	- Write full notes,  Record times
	- Involve `neurosurgeons` early, especially if reduced GCS, or if increased ICP suspected
	- Rapid examination survey
	- Record `pulse`, `BP`, `T°`, `respirations`, and `pupils` every 15min.
	- Assess `anterograde amnesia` (loss from the time of injury, i.e. post-traumatic) and `retrograde amnesia` (for events prior to injury)—extent of retrograde loss correlates with severity of injury, and never occurs without anterograde amnesia.
	- Do  blood `investigations`
	- `CNS examination`
	- `Evaluate lacerations` of face or scalp
	- Check for `CSF leak` from nose or ear or any `blood` behind the ear drum
		- if either is present, suspect basilar skull fracture
		- Do `CT` 
		- Give `tetanus toxoid`
		- Refer to `neurosurgeons` urgently
	- Palpate the neck posteriorly for tenderness and deformity,
	- If detected, or if the patient has other indicators for neck imaging, immobilize the neck and get cervical spine X-ray or CT neck (see below)
	- Radiology: As indicated: CT of head/neck (see below) Consider need for trauma series (eg CT chest/abdo/pelvis)
	- **Positioning**: Semi-prone if no spinal injury, with attention to airway and bladder care.
	
2. **CT Head Scanning Criteria:**
    
    - **<1h CT If**:
        - `GCS <13` on initial assessment, or `GCS <15` at 2h following injury.
        - Focal `neurological deficits`.
        - Suspected open or depressed `skull fractures`, 
        - signs of basal skull fractures e.g. `periobital ecchymoses` (‘panda’ eyes/racoon sign), `postauricular ecchymosis` (Battle’s sign), `CSF leak` through nose/ears, `hemotympanum`.
        - Post-traumatic `seizure`
        - `Vomiting` more than once.
    - **<8h CT If**:
        - Any `loss of consciousness` or `amnesia`, with one of the following:
            - Age ≥65
            - Coagulopathy
            - High-impact injury (e.g., vehicle collision, fall >1m)
            - Retrograde amnesia >30min.
3. **If Cervical Spine Injury suspected**:
    
    - **<1h CT** if:
        - GCS <13,
        - patient intubated,
        - Requires urgent definitive diagnosis of cervical spine injury (e.g., before surgery).
        - Requires being scanned for injuries in other parts of the body, such as with multiple injuries.
        - High-risk features like age >65, high-impact injury, focal neurological deficit, or paraesthesia in limbs. 
    - **< 1h X-ray** of cervical spine can be done if the above-listed criteria are `NOT` met.
4. **Admission Criteria:**
    
    - New clinically significant `CT abnormalities`.
    - `GCS <15` after CT, regardless of CT result or continuing worrying signs (e.g. vomiting).
    - when `CT indications` met but CT unavailable
    - Suspicion of non-accidental injury, drugs/alcohol, Meningism, CSF leak, or shock.

> [!Note] 
> 
> Do not attribute reduced GCS to alcohol until a significant head injury has been excluded.
> Alcohol is an unlikely cause of coma if plasma alcohol <44mmol/L. 
> If unavailable, estimate blood alcohol level from the osmolar gap. 
> If blood alcohol ≈ 40mmol/L, osmolar gap ≈ 40mmol/L.

5. **Transfer and Neurosurgical Consultation:**
    
    - Discuss cases with significant CT abnormalities, persistent low GCS, deteriorating GCS, or other complications.
    - Ensure skilled medical escort and consider intubation before transfer if needed.
