# Head Injury
### Summary:

#### Head Injury Management:

1. **Initial Priority:**
    
    - **Stabilize Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC)**.
    - If **GCS ≤8**, urgently involve anesthesia and ICU for airway protection.
    - **Involve neurosurgeons early** if GCS reduced or increased ICP is suspected.
    - Regular neurological monitoring: pulse, BP, temperature, respirations, and pupils every 15 minutes.
    - Assess amnesia (anterograde and retrograde) to evaluate injury severity.
    - **Positioning**: Semi-prone if no spinal injury, with attention to airway and bladder care.
2. **CT Head Scanning Criteria:**
    
    - **<1h CT**:
        - GCS <13 or GCS <15 after 2 hours.
        - Focal neurological deficits.
        - Suspected skull fractures, including basal skull fractures (e.g., "panda eyes", "Battle's sign", CSF leak, haemotympanum).
        - Post-traumatic seizure or vomiting more than once.
    - **<8h CT**:
        - Any loss of consciousness or amnesia, with one of the following:
            - Age ≥65
            - Coagulopathy
            - High-impact injury (e.g., vehicle collision, fall >1m)
            - Retrograde amnesia >30min.
3. **Cervical Spine Injury:**
    
    - **<1h CT** if:
        - GCS <13, patient intubated, or requires urgent cervical spine diagnosis (e.g., before surgery).
        - High-risk features like age >65, high-impact injury, neurological deficit, or paraesthesia in limbs.
    - **Low-Risk Features**: If absent, assess neck movement and, if needed, obtain **plain X-rays** within 1 hour. If the X-ray is inadequate or abnormal, proceed to CT.
4. **Admission Criteria:**
    
    - New clinically significant CT abnormalities.
    - GCS <15 post-CT or other worrying signs (e.g., vomiting).
    - Suspicion of non-accidental injury, drugs/alcohol, CSF leak, or shock.
5. **Alcohol and Coma:**
    
    - Do not attribute reduced GCS to alcohol until a head injury is excluded.
    - **Plasma alcohol <44mmol/L**: unlikely to cause coma.
    - Blood alcohol can be estimated from osmolar gap.
6. **Transfer and Neurosurgical Consultation:**
    
    - Discuss cases with significant CT abnormalities, persistent low GCS, deteriorating GCS, or other complications.
    - Ensure skilled medical escort and consider intubation before transfer if needed.
7. **Complications:**
    
    - **Early**: Extradural/subdural hemorrhage, seizures.
    - **Late**: Subdural hematoma, seizures, diabetes insipidus, parkinsonism, dementia.
8. **Poor Prognosis Indicators**:
    
    - Old age, decerebrate rigidity, extensor spasms, prolonged coma, high BP, low PaO2, and T° >39°C.
    - **Survival**: 60% of those with >1 month loss of consciousness may survive, but with significant care needs (daily nursing).

### **Investigation & Management Algorithm:**

1. **Initial Stabilization**: ABC management. GCS ≤8 → urgent anaesthetic and ICU involvement.
2. **Neurosurgical Consultation**: Early involvement if reduced GCS or signs of increased ICP.
3. **Neurological Monitoring**: Assess vitals and neurological status (every 15 mins).
4. **CT Head (if criteria met)**:
    - **<1h**: GCS <13 or <15 after 2h, focal deficits, suspected fractures, seizures, vomiting.
    - **<8h**: Loss of consciousness or amnesia with risk factors.
5. **Cervical Spine Injury**: If indicated by risk features, perform CT or X-ray (plain if low-risk).
6. **Admission**: Based on CT abnormalities, GCS <15, and concerns (e.g., alcohol, injury).
7. **Neurosurgical Discussion**: For severe abnormalities, deteriorating condition, or other concerns.
8. **Complications Management**: Watch for early hemorrhage, seizures, and late sequelae (e.g., diabetes insipidus, dementia).
9. **Prognosis Assessment**: Consider age and signs of severe injury for outcome prediction.
