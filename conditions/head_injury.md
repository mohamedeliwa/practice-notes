# Head Injury

<mark> If the pupils are unequal, </mark> diagnose rising intracranial pressure (ICP), e.g. from extradural
hemorrhage, and summon urgent neurosurgical help.

Retinal vein pulsation at `fundoscopy` helps exclude increased ICP.

## Management

1. **Initial Priority:**
	
	- <mark> Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation </mark>(ABC) remains the 1st priority. 
	- <mark> If GCS ≤8 </mark> then seek urgent anesthetic and ICU help to protect airway. 
	- Write full notes,  Record times
	- Involve `neurosurgeons` early, especially if reduced GCS, or if increased ICP suspected
	- Examine the CNS.
	- Record `pulse`, `BP`, `T°`, `respirations`, and `pupils` every 15min.
	- Assess `anterograde amnesia` (loss from the time of injury, i.e. post-traumatic) and `retrograde amnesia` (for events prior to injury)—extent of retrograde loss correlates with severity of injury, and never occurs without anterograde amnesia.
	- **Positioning**: Semi-prone if no spinal injury, with attention to airway and bladder care.
	
2. **CT Head Scanning Criteria:**
    
    - **<1h CT**:
        - GCS <13 or GCS <15 after 2 hours.
        - Focal neurological deficits.
        - Suspected skull fractures, including basal skull fractures (e.g., "panda eyes", "Battle's sign", CSF leak, haemotympanum).
        - Post-traumatic seizure or vomiting more than once.
    - **<8h CT**:
        - Any loss of consciousness or amnesia, with one of the following:
            - Age ≥65
            - Coagulopathy
            - High-impact injury (e.g., vehicle collision, fall >1m)
            - Retrograde amnesia >30min.
3. **Cervical Spine Injury:**
    
    - **<1h CT** if:
        - GCS <13, patient intubated, or requires urgent cervical spine diagnosis (e.g., before surgery).
        - High-risk features like age >65, high-impact injury, neurological deficit, or paraesthesia in limbs.
    - **Low-Risk Features**: If absent, assess neck movement and, if needed, obtain **plain X-rays** within 1 hour. If the X-ray is inadequate or abnormal, proceed to CT.
4. **Admission Criteria:**
    
    - New clinically significant CT abnormalities.
    - GCS <15 post-CT or other worrying signs (e.g., vomiting).
    - Suspicion of non-accidental injury, drugs/alcohol, CSF leak, or shock.
5. **Alcohol and Coma:**
    
    - Do not attribute reduced GCS to alcohol until a head injury is excluded.
    - **Plasma alcohol <44mmol/L**: unlikely to cause coma.
    - Blood alcohol can be estimated from osmolar gap.
6. **Transfer and Neurosurgical Consultation:**
    
    - Discuss cases with significant CT abnormalities, persistent low GCS, deteriorating GCS, or other complications.
    - Ensure skilled medical escort and consider intubation before transfer if needed.
7. **Complications:**
    
    - **Early**: Extradural/subdural hemorrhage, seizures.
    - **Late**: Subdural hematoma, seizures, diabetes insipidus, parkinsonism, dementia.
8. **Poor Prognosis Indicators**:
    
    - Old age, decerebrate rigidity, extensor spasms, prolonged coma, high BP, low PaO2, and T° >39°C.
    - **Survival**: 60% of those with >1 month loss of consciousness may survive, but with significant care needs (daily nursing).

### **Investigation & Management Algorithm:**

1. **Initial Stabilization**: ABC management. GCS ≤8 → urgent anaesthetic and ICU involvement.
2. **Neurosurgical Consultation**: Early involvement if reduced GCS or signs of increased ICP.
3. **Neurological Monitoring**: Assess vitals and neurological status (every 15 mins).
4. **CT Head (if criteria met)**:
    - **<1h**: GCS <13 or <15 after 2h, focal deficits, suspected fractures, seizures, vomiting.
    - **<8h**: Loss of consciousness or amnesia with risk factors.
5. **Cervical Spine Injury**: If indicated by risk features, perform CT or X-ray (plain if low-risk).
6. **Admission**: Based on CT abnormalities, GCS <15, and concerns (e.g., alcohol, injury).
7. **Neurosurgical Discussion**: For severe abnormalities, deteriorating condition, or other concerns.
8. **Complications Management**: Watch for early hemorrhage, seizures, and late sequelae (e.g., diabetes insipidus, dementia).
9. **Prognosis Assessment**: Consider age and signs of severe injury for outcome prediction.
