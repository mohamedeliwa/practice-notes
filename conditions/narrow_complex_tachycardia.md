# Narrow complex tachycardia

ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms (<3 small squares at the rate of 25mm/s).

Differential diagnosis : Sinus tachycardia, Atrial fibrillation (AF), Atrial flutter, Atrial tachycardia, Multifocal atrial tachycardia, AV nodal re-entry tachycardia, AV re-entry tachycardia (e.g. WPW)

> [!note] 
> 
> **Sinus tachycardia**: is not an arrhythmia! Do not attempt to cardiovert;\
> If necessary (i.e. not a physiological response to fever/hypovolemia) rate control with `Beta-blockers`.

## Management

Be guided by patient status.

<mark> If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion </mark>

- Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly
- Decide whether the rhythm is regular or not
- `Vagal maneuvers`: transiently increase AV block, and may show the underlying atrial rhythm
-  If vagal maneuvers are unsuccessful 
- `Adenosine`: 6mg IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline flush 
- While recording a rhythm strip
- If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg, then one further 12mg bolus.

## Specific Management

### Sinus tachycardia

Identify and treat underlying cause
### Supraventricular tachycardia

- If `adenosine` fails
- Use `verapamil` 2.5–5mg IV over 2min. (NOT if on a beta-blocker)
- If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age <60yrs)
- `Verapamil` alternatives
- `Atenolol` 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given
- `Amiodarone`
- If all unsuccessful, use `DC cardioversion`

### Atrial fibrillation

- If the patient has adverse signs (shock, myocardial ischemia (chest pain or ECG changes), syncope, heart failure)
- <mark> ABCDE </mark>
- <mark> DC cardioversion  </mark> (synchronized shock, start at 120–150J)
- ± `Amiodarone` if unsuccessful
- If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago: rate or rhythm control may be tried.
- For rhythm control, `DC cardiovert` or give `flecainide` (CI: structural heart disease, IHD) or `amiodarone`.
- Start`heparin` in case cardioversion is delayed
- If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset
- Rate control (e.g. with `bisoprolol` or `diltiazem`).
- If rhythm control is chosen, the patient must be `anticoagulated` for >3wks first.
- Correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+)
- Treat associated illnesses (e.g. MI, pneumonia); 
- Consider anticoagulation

### Atrial flutter

- Similar to AF regarding rate and rhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.
- `DC cardioversion` is preferred to pharmacological cardioversion; start with 70–120J.
- `Amiodarone IV` may be needed if rate control is proving difficult.
-  `Radiofrequency ablation` is often recommended for long-term management as recurrence rates are high.

### Atrial tachycardia

- Rare, maybe due digoxin toxicity or withdraw digoxin 
- Consider `Digoxin-specific antibody fragments`
- Maintain `K+` at 4–5mmol/L.

### Multifocal atrial tachycardia

- Most commonly occurs in COPD
- Correct hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Consider `verapamil` if rate remains >110bpm.

### Junctional tachycardia

- `Vagal maneuvers`
- If it fails, `Adenosine`
- `Beta-blockers` (or `verapamil`—not with Beta-blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine)
- If all fails, consider `radiofrequency ablation`


### Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome

- `Flecainide`, `propafenone`, `sotalol`, or `amiodarone`.
-  Electrophysiology and ablation of the accessory pathway.
