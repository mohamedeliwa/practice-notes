# Narrow complex tachycardia

ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms (<3 small squares at the rate of 25mm/s).

Differential diagnosis : Sinus tachycardia, Atrial fibrillation (AF), Atrial flutter, Atrial tachycardia, Multifocal atrial tachycardia, AV nodal re-entry tachycardia, AV re-entry tachycardia (e.g. WPW)

> [!note] 
> 
> **Sinus tachycardia**: is not an arrhythmia! Do not attempt to cardiovert;\
> If necessary (i.e. not a physiological response to fever/hypovolemia) rate control with `Beta-blockers`.

## Management

Be guided by patient status.

<mark> If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion </mark>

- `Oxygen` if SaO2 <90%
- `IV access` 
- `12-lead ECG`
- **If the patient has adverse signs** (shock, myocardial ischemia (chest pain or ECG changes), syncope, heart failure)
- `Sedation`
- <mark> Synchronized DC </mark> Up to 3 shocks 70–120J for the first shock (120–150J for AF)*
- Then120–360J for subsequent shocks
- Check and correct K+, Mg2+, Ca2+
-  `Amiodarone` 300mg IV over ≥20min
- Consider repeat shock
- Then `Amiodarone` 900mg/24h IVI (via central line)
- **If No adverse signs**
- Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly
- Decide whether the rhythm is regular or not
- **If Irregular**, treat as AF (the most likely diagnosis) (see below)
- **If regular**
- Start continuous `ECG` trace
- `Vagal maneuvers` (caution if possible digoxin toxicity, acute ischemia or carotid bruit)
- If it fails, `Adenosine`: 6mg IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline flush
- If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg bolus, then one further 12mg bolus (if necessary).
- If adenosine fails or contraindicated 
- `Verapamil` 2.5–5mg over 2min is an alternative (see below for Verapamil alternatives)
- **If Sinus rhythm achieved**
- Probable paroxysmal re-entrant SVT
- Assess ECG for e.g. WPW If recurrent consider referral for electrophysiology/prophylaxis (see below)
- **If Sinus rhythm Not achieved**, Possible atrial flutter (Control rate with, e.g. Beta-blocker) (see below)

> If a monophasic shock used, higher energies will be required.

## Specific Management

### Sinus tachycardia

Identify and treat underlying cause
### Supraventricular tachycardia

- If `adenosine` fails
- Use `verapamil` 2.5–5mg IV over 2min. (NOT if on a beta-blocker)
- If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age <60yrs)
- `Verapamil` alternatives are:
- `Atenolol` 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given
- Or `Amiodarone`
- If all unsuccessful, use `DC cardioversion`

### Atrial fibrillation

- **If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago**: rate or rhythm control may be tried.
- For rhythm control, `DC cardiovert` under `sedation`
- Or give `flecainide` 300mg oral (only if definitely no structural heart damage) (CI: structural heart disease, IHD) 
- Or `amiodarone` 300mg IVI over 20–60min, then 900mg over 24h.
- Start`heparin` in case cardioversion is delayed
- **If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset**
- Rate control with one of the following:
- Beta-blocker: e.g. `metoprolol` 1–10mg IV, give small increments to slow rate
- Or `Verapamil` 5–10mg IV
- Or `Digoxin` is an alternative in heart failure (load with e.g. 500mcg oral then 500mcg oral after 8h and further 250mcg oral after 8h)
- Or `Amiodarine` (may also control rhythm, see above)
- Consider anticoagulation with `warfarin` or `NOAC`.
- **If rhythm control is chosen**, the patient must be `anticoagulated` for >3wks first.
- Correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+)
- Treat associated illnesses (e.g. MI, pneumonia)

### Atrial flutter

- Similar to AF regarding rate and rhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.
- `DC cardioversion` is preferred to pharmacological cardioversion; start with 70–120J.
- `Amiodarone IV` may be needed if rate control is proving difficult.
- `Radiofrequency ablation` is often recommended for long-term management as recurrence rates are high.

### Atrial tachycardia

- Rare, maybe due digoxin toxicity or withdraw digoxin 
- Consider `Digoxin-specific antibody fragments`
- Maintain `K+` at 4–5mmol/L.

### Multifocal atrial tachycardia

- Most commonly occurs in COPD
- Correct hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Consider `verapamil` if rate remains >110bpm.

### Junctional tachycardia

- `Vagal maneuvers`
- If it fails, `Adenosine`
- If it fails or recurs, `Beta-blockers` (or `verapamil`—not with Beta-blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine)
- If all fails, consider `radiofrequency ablation`


### Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome

- `Flecainide`, `propafenone`, `sotalol`, or `amiodarone`.
-  Electrophysiology and ablation of the accessory pathway.
