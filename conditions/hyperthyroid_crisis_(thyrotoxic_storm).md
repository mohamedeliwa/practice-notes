# Hyperthyroid crisis (thyrotoxic storm)


**Do not wait for test results** if urgent treatment is needed.

## Investigations

- `TSH`, free `T4`, free `T3`. 
- Confirm with `technetium` uptake if possible.

## Management

1. `IV access`, fluids if dehydrated. 
2. `NG tube` if vomiting
3. Take blood for: `T3`, `T4`, `TSH`, `cultures` (if infection suspected)
4. `Sedate` if necessary (e.g. `chlorpromazine` 50mg oral/IM). `Monitor BP`
5. If no contraindication, and cardiac output OK, give `propranolol` 60mg/4–6h oral; 
	- max IV dose: 1mg over 10min; 
	- may need repeating every few hours. 
	- In <mark> asthma/poor cardiac output, propranolol has caused cardiac arrest </mark> in thyroid storm, so `ultra-short-acting β-blockers` have a role, e.g. IV `esmolol`. 
	- Consider `diltiazem` if β-blockers contraindicated.
6. High-dose `digoxin` may be needed to slow the heart, but ensure adequately β-blocked, give with cardiac monitoring
7. **Antithyroid drugs**: `carbimazole` 15–25mg/6h oral (or via NGT); after 4h give `Lugol’s solution` (aqueous iodine oral solution) 0.3mL/8h oral well diluted in water for 7–10d to block thyroid
8. `Hydrocortisone` 100mg/6h IV or `dexamethasone` 2mg/6h oral to prevent peripheral conversion T4 to T3
9. Treat suspected infection, e.g. with `co-amoxiclav` 1.2g/8h IV
10. Adjust `IV fluids` as necessary; cool with `tepid sponging` ± `paracetamol`
11. If you are not making headway in 24h, `thyroidectomy` may be an option.
12. **Continuing treatment**: 
	1. After 5d reduce `carbimazole` to 15mg/8h oral.
	2. After 10d stop `propranolol` and `iodine`. Adjust `carbimazole`
