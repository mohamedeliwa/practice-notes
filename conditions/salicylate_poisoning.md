# Salicylate poisoning

Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic metabolism and the production of lactate and heat.\
Effects are dose related and potentially fatal: 
- 150mg/kg: mild toxicity.
- 250mg/kg: moderate 
- >500mg/kg: severe toxicity.
- Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal.

## **Investigations**

- `Paracetamol` and `salicylate level`
- `Glucose` 
- `Urea`, `Creatinine` 
- `Electrolytes`
- `Liver Function Tests`
- `INR` 
- `ABG`
- `CBC`
- `HCO3`
- `Urine PH`
## **Management**

1. General measures: (See Acute poisoning article—general measures). 
2. Correct dehydration.
3. Keep patient on ECG monitor.
4. Give `activated charcoal` to all presenting ≲1h—consider even if delayed presentation, at least one dose of 1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart).
5. Do Investigations (see above)
6. `Salicylate level` may need to be repeated after 2h
7. Monitor blood glucose 1–2hrly (beware hypoglycemia)
8. if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and Urea, Creatinine, & Electrolytes.
9. `Catheterization` to monitor urine output and pH
10. `Correct acidosis`: If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe metabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, e.g. with 1.5L 1.26% `sodium bicarbonate` IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5–8.
11. Monitor `serum K+` as hypokalemia may occur, and should be treated (caution if AKI).
12. `Dialysis` may well be needed if salicylate level >700mg/L, and if AKI or heart failure, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, confusion or seizures, severe acidosis despite best medical therapy, or persistently ↑plasma salicylate. Contact nephrology early.
