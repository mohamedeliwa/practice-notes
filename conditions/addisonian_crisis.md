# Addisonian crisis

Patients may present in shock, often (but not always) in a patient with known Addison’s, or someone on long-term steroids who has forgotten their tablets. Remember bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (e.g. meningococcemia) as a cause. An alternative presentation is with hypoglycemia.

## Investigations

 - `Cortisol` and `ACTH` (this needs to go straight to laboratory, call ahead!)
 - `Urea` & `Creatinine`
 - `Electrolytes`—can have ↑ K+ (check ECG and give calcium gluconate if needed) and ↓ Na+ (salt depletion, should resolve with rehydration and steroids).
## Management 

If suspected, treat before biochemical results.

1. `Hydrocortisone` 100mg IV stat.
2. `IV fluid` bolus e.g. 500mL `0.9% saline` to support BP, repeated as necessary.
3. Monitor blood glucose: the danger is `hypoglycemia`.
4. Blood, urine, sputum for `culture`, then `antibiotics` if concern about infection.

**Continuing treatment**
1. `Glucose IV` may be needed if hypoglycemic.
2. Give `IV fluids` as guided by clinical state and to correct Urea, creatinine, & Electrolytes imbalance.
3. Continue `hydrocortisone`, e.g. 100mg/8h IV or IM.
4. Change to `oral steroids` after 72h if patient’s condition good.
5. `Fludrocortisone` may well be needed if the cause is adrenal disease: ask an expert.
6. Search for (and vigorously treat) the underlying cause. Get endocrinological help.
