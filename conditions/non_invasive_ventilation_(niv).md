# Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV)/(NPPV)

NIV has two major modes of supplying ventilatory support, namely, continuous positive airway pressure (`CPAP`) and bilevel positive airway pressure (`BiPAP`).

## When to Use NIV

Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure

- Severe dyspnea at rest
- Respiratory rate >25 breaths/min
- Use of accessory muscle of respiration
- Acute respiratory acidosis (pH <7.30)
- An alert and cooperative patient

Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure

- Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min
- PaO₂/FiO₂ <200
- Increased use of accessory muscle or PaCO₂ retention
- Alert and cooperative patient

> [!Note]
>
> Patients may feel claustrophobic, especially when increasing respiratory drive and when difficult breathing is present. <br />
> NIV is tolerated best when pressures are increased gradually, as the work of breathing and respiratory drive eases

## Initial Settings

- Spontaneous trigger mode with backup rate
- Start with low pressures
  - `IPAP` 8–12 cm H₂O
  - `PEEP` 3–5 cm H₂O
- Adjust inspired O₂ to keep O₂ sat >90 %
- Increase IPAP gradually up to 20 cm H₂O (as tolerated) to:
  - alleviate dyspnea
  - decrease respiratory rate
  - increase tidal volume
  - establish patient-ventilator synchrony

## Backup rates in COPD

- backup rate: 15 breaths/min
- backup inspiration:expiration ratio: 1:3

> [!Note]
>
> Airway pressures above 20 cm H₂O are not advised because they are poorly tolerated by patients, and promote air leaks around the face masks.

## Success and Failure Criteria for NIPPV

- Improvements in pH and PCO₂ occurring within 2 h predict the eventual success of NIV.
- If stabilization or improvement has not been achieved during this time period, the patient should be considered an `NPPV failure` and `intubation` must be strongly considered.
- Other criteria for a failed NPPV trial include:
  - worsened encephalopathy or agitation
  - inability to clear secretions
  - inability to tolerate any available mask
  - hemodynamic instability
  - worsened oxygenation
