# Hypopituitary coma

Think of decompensated chronic hypophyseal failure whenever hypothermia, refractory hypotension ± septic signs without fever occur with short stature or loss of axillary/pubic hair ± gonadal atrophy. <mark> Waiting for lab conﬁrmation may be fatal. </mark> 

It usually develops gradually in a person with known hypopituitarism. 
If rapid onset due to pituitary infarction (e.g. postpartum, Sheehan’s), subarachnoid hemorrhage is often misdiagnosed as symptoms include headache and meningism.


## Investigations

- `Cortisol`
- `T4`, `TSH`
- `ACTH`
- `Glucose` 
- Pituitary fossa `CT/MRI`

## Treatment

1. `Hydrocortisone`, e.g. 100mg IV/6h.
2. Only after hydrocortisone begun: `liothyronine` (L-tri-iodothyronine sodium), e.g. 10mcg/12h oral or by slow IV: 5–20mcg/12h (4-hourly may be needed). 
3. `Prompt surgery` is needed if the cause is pituitary apoplexy.
