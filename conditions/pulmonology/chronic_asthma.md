# Chronic Asthma

## Investigations

Baseline investigations

- `BEF`/Simple `spirometry`, The diagnosis is highly likely if:

  - 20% diurnal PEF variation on >3 days/​week, in a week of peak flow diary measures
  - FEV1 ≥15% decrease after 6 min exercise
  - FEV1 ≥15% (and 200 mL) increase after 2-​week trial of oral steroid (30 mg prednisolone od)

- `Bronchodilator reversibilty` test

  - FEV1 ≥15% (and 200 mL) increase after a single dose of a short-​acting β2 agonist therapy (e.g. salbutamol 4 puffs (400 micrograms) by metred dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or 2.5 mg by nebulizer)
  - A 400 mL improvement is strongly suggestive of asthma; smaller improvements are less sensitive and need careful interpretation.

Further investigations

- `CBC` (eosinophilia is common)
- IgE
- Fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration (`FeNO`) (to assess compliance)
- `CXR` (if atypical symptoms)
- Skin prick tests
- `Methacholine/histamine challenge`
- Bronchial provocation tests
- Induced sputum analysis (eosinphilia)
- Aspergillus specific IgE/IgG (if ABPA suspected)
- Laryngoscopy/ENT examination
- Bronchoscopy (if obstructing airway tumor is suspected)
- Lung biopsy (if no adequate explanation for persistent and minimally reversible airflow obstruction)

## Management

- Consider D.D if unusual features in the history, or poor correlation between objective measures and symptoms, or poor treatment response

- use a step-​up/​step-​down approach, start at the step most appropriate to severity, based on the history, spirometry, and medication usage.

- move up if needed, or down if control is good for >3 months.

- Inhaler technique and treatment adherence should be assessed at each step.

- At each step, every patient should have a reliever inhaler, either low-dose ICS-formoterol (preferred) or SABA.

symptoms < twice/month

- `low-dose inhaled cortico-steroid (ICS) and LABA inhaler` (e.g budesonide-formoterol) as needed for symptoms relief
- Alternatively, use low-dose ICS whenever a SABA is needed

symptoms ≥ twice a month but < than daily

- Daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA
- Or as-needed low-dose ICS-LABA.
- `Leukotriene` receptor antagonists (LTRA) are an alternative if avoiding ICS, but less efficacious.

symptoms most days, or waking with asthma once a week or more

- Low-dose `ICS-LABA maintenance and reliever therapy` (preferred)
- Or daily low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus as-needed `SABA`.
- add `LAMA` (eg tiotropium) if LABA contraindicated/not tolerated

symptoms most days, or waking with asthma once a week or more, or low lung function

- `Medium-dose ICS-LABA` as maintenance and reliever therapy.
- Alternative options include high-dose ICS, add-on tiotropium, or add-on LTRA.

symptoms are higher than above

- `High-dose ICS-LABA`.
- Refer for phenotypic assessment ± add-on therapy, eg tiotropium, anti-IgE, anti-IL-5/5R, anti-IL-4R.
- Some patients may benefit from low-dose oral corticosteroids but long-term systemic SE are common and serious.

## Therapies

Intermittent reliever therapy

- Inhaled short-​acting β2 agonist or ipratropium bromide
- Ten puffs/​day (two or more canisters/​month) = poorly controlled disease.
- ICS/LABA can be used as reliever therapy if a rapid-​onset LABA, e.g. formoterol, is used.

Regular preventer therapy

- Start at 200 micrograms/​day `beclomethasone dipropionate` (BDP) or equivalent in a twice-​daily dose
- Titrate steroid dose to symptoms, aiming for lowest effective dose
- Local steroid side effects only (oral Candida, dysphonia) from BDP ≤800 micrograms/​day
- Possible dose-​related bone density effects at 800 micrograms/​day or above

Initial add-on therapy

- If uncontrolled despite taking 200–​800 micrograms/​day ICS
- add a `LABA` (eg salmeterol 50mcg/12h by inhaler).
- A combination ICS/​LABA preparation is generally preferred
- The combination of ICS/​LABA can be used as maintenance and reliever therapy (MART therapy), if a rapid-​onset LABA, e.g. formoterol, is used.

Additional add-on therapies

- If adding LABA has beneﬁt but still inadequate control, continue and ↑ dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/day.
- If no effect then stop LABA and ↑ dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/day or equivalent.
- `Leukotriene` receptor antagonist. Trial for 4 weeks and stop if no benefit

Specialist therapies

- `Tiotropium bromide` (2 puffs (2.5 mcg) once daily) may help reducing exacerbation frequency when added to ICS/​LABA.
- `Theophylline` may be trialled but needs therapeutic drug monitoring
- If control is inadequate on 800 micrograms BDP equivalent with a LABA, can increase inhaled steroid dose to `2,000 micrograms BDP` equivalent in a combination inhaler
- If not controlled on the above treatments may require `long-​term oral steroids`. aim is to control asthma using the lowest possible doses.
  - (eg prednisolone in lower dose 5–10mg/24h)
  - Risk of side effects if on oral steroids for >3 months or 3–​4 courses/​years
  - Start osteoporosis prophylaxis with calcium and vitamin D, or a bisphosphonate.
  - Document baseline bone densitometry if receiving prednisolone for >3 months

Monoclonal antibody therapy

- `Omalizumab` is given as a subcutaneous injection 2–​4 weekly.
- Can be used for severe persistent allergic asthma,
- Which is unstable despite optimized standard therapy (continuous oral steroid or >4 courses/​year).
- And with a serum IgE level of 30–700IU/mL
- Response is assessed at 16 weeks.

## Asthma action plan (self management plan)

All patients with sever asthma should have

- their own peak flow meter
- regular checks on compliance and inhaler
- how to recognize loss of asthma control
- action to take if asthma deteriorates
  - Patients may increase their ICS dose fourfold at the start of an exacerbation to try and avoid a course of OCS.
  - This may be achieved by adding an additional ICS inhaler to ICS/​LABA combinations.
