# Chronic Asthma

## Investigations

Baseline investigations

- `BEF`/Simple `spirometry`, The diagnosis is highly likely if:

  - 20% diurnal PEF variation on >3 days/​week, in a week of peak flow diary measures
  - FEV1 ≥15% decrease after 6 min exercise
  - FEV1 ≥15% (and 200 mL) increase after 2-​week trial of oral steroid (30 mg prednisolone od)

- `Bronchodilator reversibilty` test

  - FEV1 ≥15% (and 200 mL) increase after a single dose of a short-​acting β2 agonist therapy (e.g. salbutamol 4 puffs (400 micrograms) by metred dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or 2.5 mg by nebulizer)
  - A 400 mL improvement is strongly suggestive of asthma; smaller improvements are less sensitive and need careful interpretation.

Further investigations

- `CBC` (eosinophilia is common)
- IgE
- Fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration (`FeNO`) (to assess compliance)
- `CXR` (if atypical symptoms)
- Skin prick tests
- Methacholine/histamine challenge
- Bronchial provocation tests
- Induced sputum analysis (eosinphilia)
- Aspergillus specific IgE/IgG (if ABPA suspected)
- Laryngoscopy/ENT examination
- Bronchoscopy (if obstructing airway tumor is suspected)
- Lung biopsy (if no adequate explanation for persistent and minimally reversible airflow obstruction)

## Management

- Consider D.D if unusual features in the history, or poor correlation between objective measures and symptoms, or poor treatment response

- use a step-​up/​step-​down approach, start at the step most appropriate to severity, based on the history, spirometry, and medication usage.

- move up if needed, or down if control is good for >3 months.

- Inhaler technique and treatment adherence should be assessed at each step.

- At each step, every patient should have a reliever inhaler, either low-dose ICS-formoterol (preferred) or SABA.

symptoms < twice/month

- low-dose ICS and LABA inhaler (e.g budesonide-formoterol)
- Alternatively, use low-dose ICS whenever a SABA is needed

symptoms ≥ twice a month but < than daily

- Daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA
- Or as-needed low-dose ICS-LABA.
- Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are an alternative if avoiding ICS, but less efficacious.

symptoms most days, or waking with asthma once a week or more

- Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance and reliever therapy (preferred)
- Or daily low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus as-needed SABA.
- add LAMA (eg tiotropium) if LABA contraindicated/not tolerated

symptoms most days, or waking with asthma once a week or more, or low lung function

- Medium-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance and reliever therapy.
- Alternative options include high-dose ICS, add-on tiotropium, or add-on LTRA.

symptoms are higher than above

- High-dose ICS-LABA.
- Refer for phenotypic assessment ± add-on therapy, eg tiotropium, anti-IgE, anti-IL-5/5R, anti-IL-4R.
- Some patients may benefit from low-dose oral corticosteroids but long-term systemic SE are common and serious.

## Therapies

Intermittent reliever therapy

- Inhaled short-​acting β2 agonist or ipratropium bromide
- Ten puffs/​day (two or more canisters/​month) = poorly controlled disease.
- ICS/LABA can be used as reliever therapy if a rapid-​onset LABA, e.g. formoterol, is used.

Regular preventer therapy

- Start at 200 micrograms/​day beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent in a twice-​daily dose
- Titrate steroid dose to symptoms, aiming for lowest effective dose
- Local steroid side effects only (oral Candida, dysphonia) from BDP ≤800 micrograms/​day
- Possible dose-​related bone density effects at 800 micrograms/​day or above

Initial add-on therapy
