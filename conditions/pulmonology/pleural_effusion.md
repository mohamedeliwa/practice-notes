# Pleural effusion

↑, ↓
A peural effusion results from the accumulation of abnormal volumes
(>10–​20 mL) of fluid in the pleural space.

Commonest causes in the UK and USA (in order): cardiac failure, pneumonia, malignancy, pulmonary embolus (PE).

## Consider admission and chest drain insertion for:

- malignant effusions which are candidates for pleurodesis
- Empyema (pus) or complicated parapneumonic effusion (pleural fluid pH <7.2)
- Patients who are unwell with an acute massive effusion.

## Investigations

- `CXR`
- Pleural `US`
- `Thoracentesis`
  - Note pleural fuild appearance
  - Biochemistry (`glucose`, `protein`, `LDH`)
  - `Cytology` (for malignant cells and differential cell count)
  - `Microbiology` (Gram stain, `culture`)
  - For suspected pleural infection (send pleural fluid in blood culture bottles)
  - `AFB stain`, and `TB culture`
  - ABG (for `PH`) For non-purulent effusion
  - depending on clinical circumstances (cholesterol, triglycerides, chylomicrons,
    `haematocrit`, `adenosine deaminase`, fungal stains, and amylase)
- `CT chest` with pleural phase contrast (ideally scan prior to complete fluid drainage)
- `CTPA` if PE possible
- Pleural tissue `biopsy` for histology and TB culture using image-​guided
  or thoracoscopic biopsies. These techniques are superior to Abrams’
  closed pleural biopsy for malignant disease and TB

- Serum/Pleural tumor markers for suspected malignant effusion, (e.g. CEA, CA19-​9, CA15-​3, CA125, PSA, Mesothelin), But should not be routinely used for investigation of pleural effusions due to poor sensitivity.

## pleural effusion a transudate or an exudate?

- In patients with a normal serum protein
  - pleural fluid protein <30 g/​L = transudate
  - protein >40 g/​L = exudate
- In borderline cases (protein 30–​40 g/​L) or in patients with abnormal serum protein, apply Light’s criteria

## Light’s criteria

effusion is exudative if it meets one of following criteria:

- Pleural fluid protein/​serum protein ratio >0.5
- Pleural fluid LDH/​serum LDH ratio >0.6
- Pleural fluid LDH > two-​thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH.

These criteria are very sensitive in the diagnosis of exudative effusions although may occasionally falsely identify transudates as being exudates, e.g. patients with partially treated heart failure on diuretics may be misidentified as exudates. N-​terminal pro-​brain natriuretic peptide (NT-​proBNP) in pleural fluid or blood may be of use in these cases. Similarly, a total protein gradient (serum-​pleural fluid total protein) >31 g/​L is suggestive of heart failure.

## Some Pleural fluid analysis results

- Hemothorax: if pleural fluid hematocrit >50% of peripheral blood hematocrit

### Characteristics

- Putrid odour: Anaerobic empyema

- Viscous: Mesothelioma

### Predominant cells

- Neutrophils: Any acute effusion, e.g. parapneumonic, PE

- Mononuclear cells: Any chronic effusion, e.g. malignancy, TB

- Lymphocytes: TB, especially if >80%; other causes include cardiac failure, malignancy, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, rheumatoid pleurisy, post-​CABG, chylothorax

- Eosinophils: Often unhelpful;

- Mesothelial cells: Predominate in transudates; variable numbers in exudates, typically suppressed in inflammatory conditions, e.g. TB. Atypical mesothelial cells may suggest malignancy

- Lupus erythematosus cells: Diagnostic of SLE

### Some of PH, Glucose results

- Normal pleural fluid pH is about 7.6.
- An abnormally low pH (<7.3) suggests pleural inflammation/​infection and is often associated with a low pleural fluid glucose (<3.3 mmol/​L or pleural fluid/​serum glucose ratio <0.5).
- CPPE and empyema (pH <7.2, glucose <2.2 mmol/L and LDH >1000IU/L)
- Rheumatoid pleuritis (glucose <1.7 mmol/​L in 66% and <2.8 mmol/​L in 80% of cases)
- Urinothorax is the only transudative effusion that can cause aa PH <7.3.
- An abnormally high (alkaline) pH may rarely occur in the setting of Proteus
  pleural infection.

### Some of triglyceride and cholesterol results

- Chylothorax: Presence of chylomicrons or pleural fluid triglyceride level >1.24 mmol/​L

- Pseudochylothorax: raised pleural fluid cholesterol (>5.17 mmol/​L) and cholesterol crystals at polarized light microscopy distinguish it from chylothorax.

### Some of amylase results

- Abnormal if pleural fluid amylase > upper normal limit for serum amylase, or if amylase pleural fluid/​serum ratio >1.0.

> Note—​may be normal early in the course of acute pancreatitis or oesophageal rupture.

## Management

- History (including drug hx)
- Examination
- CXR, pleural US
- If obvious cause for transudative effusions (HF, hypoalbuminemia, dialysis)
  - The cause should be treated, with no need for thoracentesis
  - Unless atypical features (e.g. very asymmetrical bilateral effusions, unilateral effusion, echogenicity/septations/nodularity on US, chest pain, fever) or failure to respond to therapy.
  - If so, do thoracentesis (diagnostic and/​or therapeutic depending on clinical circumstances)
- If exudative effusion, or no obvious cause for transudative
  - Thoracentesis (diagnostic and/​or therapeutic depending on clinical circumstances)
  - If Cause apparent
  - Then treat and monitor
  - If no apparent cause
  - CT thorax with Pleural phase contrast enhancement
  - Pleural biopsy (CT/USS-guided or local anaesthetic thoracoscopy/VATS)
  - If Cause apparent
  - Then treat and monitor
  - If no apparent cause
  - Reconsider PE, TB
- Aetiology unknown in 10–15% (monitoring alone may be appropriate)

> If the patient is breathless, they may benefit from removal of a larger volume of fluid (therapeutic thoracentesis)

## Malignant Pl.effusions specific notes:

- Observation and follow-​up if asymptomatic.

- Therapeutic pleural aspiration

  - Remove 1-1.5 L to improve breathlessness
  - Post-aspiration CXR (alternatively, pleural manometry during aspiration), for evaluation of possible non-​expandable lung
  - If the breathlessness does not improve following aspiration, then there is little to be gained by repeated aspiration, and other causes should be considered, e.g. lymphangitis carcinomatosis, PE.
  - if effusion recur within 1 month of aspiration, pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) should be considered

- Intercostal chest drainage and pleurodesis

  - The effusion drained with an intercostal tube.
  - Provided lung fully re-​expands on CXR, proceed to pleurodesis
  - If lung fails to re-​expand fully (trapped lung; CXR shows a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax), consider `chest drain suction`, which may encourage lung expansion and allow pleurodesis.

- Indwelling pleural catheter insertion

  - likely to be the preferred treatment for patients with significantly trapped lung

## Parapneumonic effusion and empyema specific notes:

- Empyemas on CT, frequently appear lenticular and may exhibit the ‘split pleura’ sign of enhancing separated visceral and parietal pleura. Absence of pleural thickening on CT is unusual in empyema
- Of pleural infections, 40% are culture-​negative.
- Blood cultures positive in only 14% of cases, but, in these cases, they are often the only positive microbiology
- Bronchoscopy is only indicated if a bronchial obstructing lesion is suspected.
- (rare presentation) History of a recent sore throat may suggest Lemierre’s syndrome, consider US of internal jugular vein if suspected

- `Antibiotics`

  - Community-​acquired empyema—​β-​lactam/​β-​lactamase inhibitor (e.g. co-​amoxiclav) or second-​generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefuroxime), combined with metronidazole for anaerobic cover. Ciprofloxacin and clindamycin together may be appropriate
  - Hospital-​acquired empyema—​cover Gram-​positive and Gram-​negative organisms and anaerobes. MRSA infection is common. Consult with microbiology team. One option is meropenem and vancomycin.
  - Avoid aminoglycosides, which penetrate the pleural space poorly.
  - Switch to oral antibiotics when apyrexial and improving clinically.
  - Co-​amoxiclav is a useful single agent with anaerobic cover (not if penicillin-​allergic).
  - Optimal duration of antibiotic treatment unclear, although likely to be at least 3 weeks.

- `Chest tube drainage`

  - indications:

    - Purulent pleural fluid
    - Organisms on pleural fluid Gram stain or culture
    - Pleural fluid pH <7.2.

  - Usually apply suction (–​20 cmH2O), and flush regularly (e.g. 20 mL normal saline every 6 h)

  - Consider drain removal when clinical improvement occurs.
  - If there is no indication for drainage, give antibiotics and monitor closely.
  - If slow to improve or deteriorate, re-​sample the effusion and consider chest drain.

- `Intrapleural fibrinolytics`

  - The combination of intrapleural tPA and DNase significantly improved CXR appearances for patients with pleural infection, reduced surgical referral and hospital stay with a similar adverse event profile.

- `Nutritional support`: consider supplementary NG feeding if needed.
- `Thromboprophylaxis`:
- `Surgery`

  - Consult with thoracic surgeon if there are ongoing features of sepsis and residual pleural collection after 5–​7 days despite tube drainage and treatment with antibiotics.

- If failed to clinically improve despite antibiotics and chest drain

  - Review microbiology results, and ensure appropriate antibiotics
  - CT to assess extent of residual collection and drain position
  - Surgical referral (at days 5–​7)
  - Options if unfit for surgery:

    - Consider use of tPA/​DNase if not already used
    - Further image-​guided small-​bore drains into loculated effusions
    - Large-​bore drain
    - Surgical rib resection and open drainage under local anaesthesia.
