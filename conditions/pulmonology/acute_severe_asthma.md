# Acute severe asthma

> Fatality in asthma is due to cardiac arrest 2° to hypoxia and acidosis; reversal of hypoxia is paramount.  
> Give high-​flow O₂.

## Investigations

- `PEF` but may be too ill
- `ABG` if saturation <92% or sever features.
- `CBC`
- `CXR` if suspicion of pneumothorax, or consolidation, life-threatening attack, or failure to respond to initial treatment.
- `Glucose`
- `Urea and creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`

### Monitoring

- `PEF` on arrival, 15–​30 min after starting treatment, and regularly thereafter, according to response
- `O₂ saturation` and maintain 94–​98%
- `ABG` for pH and PaCO₂ (if saturation <92% or sever features).
  - a normal CO₂ may indicate a tiring patient.
  - a high CO₂ indicates a near-​fatal attack and should precipitate urgent review for invasive ventilatory support
- `HR` & `RR`
- `ECG` watch for arrhythmias

## Management

### Assess severity of attack

- PEF, ability to speak, RR, pulse rate, O₂ sats
- Warn ICU if severe or life-threatening attack
- see Severity of acute asthma section below

### Treatment

- Airway: ensure no upper airway obstruction
- Breathing: `High-flow O₂` (40–​60%) and high-​flow mask, e.g. Hudson; maintain sats 94–98%.
- Circulation: ​gain intravenous (IV) access.
- `Salbutamol` 2.5-5mg (or terbutaline 10mg) nebulized with O₂.
  - repeated doses or continuous, e.g. 5–​10 mg/​h
  - IV only if inhaled therapy cannot be used reliably
  - risk of hypokalemia with β2 agonist and steroids
  - Repeated use of β2 agonists may lead to lactic acidosis
- If severe add nebulized `ipratropium bromide` 0.5mg/4-6h.

- `Hydrocortisone` 100mg IV or `Prednisolone` 40–50mg oral

  - Oral is as effective as IV
  - Prednisolone continues for at least 5 days or until recovery.
  - It's sensible to continue oral steroids until peak flow is maintained for 5-7 days
  - The dose can be stopped abruptly, unless on repeated doses or long-​term steroids where needs a longer and weaning course.
  - Inhaled corticosteroids should be continued as part of the chronic disease management plan

- Reassess every 15 minutes

- Consider single dose of `magnesium sulfate` (MgSO4) 1.2–2g IV over 20min in those with severe features and poor response to above therapies

- IV `aminophylline` if poor response to initial therapy in acute severe or life-​threatening disease

  - some patients may respond
  - Dose ​5 mg/​kg loading dose over 20 min, followed by continuous infusion of 0.5-0.7 mg/​kg (500 mg in 500 mL normal saline or 0.5% glucose at 0.5 × body weight in kg/​mL/​h).
  - If on maintenance therapy, do not give loading dose, but start continuous infusion
  - Aim for plasma concentration of 10–20mcg/mL (55–110μmol/L).
  - Serious toxicity can occur at concentrations ≥25mcg/mL
  - Cardiac monitoring is required
  - May Cause hypokalemia

- `Antibiotics` only if definite infective element to the exacerbation.
- `IV fluids`: correct dehydration, and hypokalemia
- `Adrenaline` (IM) may be useful if near arrest, while awaiting ICU support.
- There is very little evidence to support the use of `NIV` in the management of asthma in the ICU setting.
- Hypercapnic respiratory failure in acute severe asthma is an urgent indication for `endotracheal intubation`.

<!-- ### If improving within 15–30min

- Nebulized `salbutamol` every 4-6h (+ ipratropium if started in previous step)
- `Prednisolone` 40–50mg oral, once daily for 5–7 days
- Monitor peak ﬂow and O₂ sats, aim 94–98% with supplemental if needed
- If PEF >75% 1h after initial treatment, consider discharge with outpatient follow-up -->

### When to refer to ICU

- if any of the following signs are present:
  - Worsening PEF despite treatments
  - Hypercapnia (or rising CO₂ even if not yet >6 kPa(45mmHg))
  - Persistent/worsening hypoxia
  - Falling pH
  - Exhaustion, poor respiratory effort
  - Drowsiness, confusion
  - Respiratory arrest

### Discharge

Consider discharge when:

- Reduced β2 agonist dose
- Off nebulized drugs and on inhalers ≥24 h
- PEF ≥75% predicted or best
- Minimal PEF diurnal variation (<25%)
- Appropriate education has been given.

Prior to discharge, consider:

- Reason for the exacerbation. Could it have been avoided?
- Check inhaler technique
- steroid (inhaled and oral) and bronchodilator therapy
- their own PEF meter and have written management plan
- GP appointment within 2d
- Respiratory clinic appointment within 4wks.

## Severity of acute asthma

### Moderate acute asthma

- Increasing symptoms
- `PEF` ≥50–​75% predicted or best
- No features of acute severe asthma
- 1h following treatment in ER, patients with PEF ≥75% predicted or best may be discharged home with appropriate changes to their asthma medication in the absence of concerns, e.g.:
  - Significant ongoing symptoms
  - Compliance concerns
  - Living alone
  - Psychological problems or learning difficulties
  - Previous near-​fatal asthma
  - Nocturnal presentation
  - Pregnant
  - Exacerbation despite adequate oral steroid pre-​presentation.

### Acute severe asthma

Defined as any of:

- `PEF` 33–​50% predicted or best
- Respiratory rate (`RR`) ≥25
- Heart rate (`HR`) ≥110
- Inability to complete sentence in one breath
- May be able to be discharged if respond well to initial treatment as above.

### Life-​threatening asthma

Any one of:

- `PEF` ≤33% predicted or best
- `SaO₂` ≤92% (needs ABG)
- `PaO₂` ≤8 kPa (60mmHg)
- `Normal CO₂` (4.6-​6 kPa (35-45mmHg))
- Silent chest
- Cyanosis
- Poor respiratory effort
- Bradycardia/​arrhythmia/​hypotension
- Exhaustion
- Altered conscious level.

### Near-​fatal asthma

- `Raised PaCO₂`, and/​or
- Needing mechanical ventilation with raised inflation pressures.
