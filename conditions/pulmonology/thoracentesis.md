# Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis (‘pleural tap’ or pleural fluid aspiration) may be diagnostic or therapeutic.

- Use a dedicated procedure room when possible
- Avoid out-​of-​hours procedures unless an emergency.
- Using `US` guidance routinely

## Diagnostic thoracentesis

- for non-​urgent thoracentesis, anticoagulated patients should have their clotting corrected to `INR` <1.5.

- Position patient sitting forward, leaning on a pillow over a table, with their arms folded in front of them

- Double-​check correct side from chest examination and CXR

- Choose aspiration site using `ultrasound`, preferably in ‘safe triangle’, unless loculated fluid makes this impossible.

- Avoid posterior approaches where possible (as the intercostal artery lies in the mid-​intercostal space posteriorly)

- Sterile skin preparation and aseptic technique

- Aim just `above the upper border` of the appropriate rib, avoiding the neurovascular bundle that runs below each rib.

- The parietal pleura is extremely sensitive, use 10–​20 mL of `1% lidocaine` (maximum 3 mg/​kg)

- Aspirate with a `green` (21G) needle and `50 mL syringe`

- Following diagnostic tap:

  - Record pleural fluid appearance

  - Sample to `biochemistry` for measurement of glucose, protein, and LDH

  - Fresh 20 mL sample to `cytology` for examination for malignant cells and differential cell count

  - Samples to `microbiology` for Gram stain and microscopy, culture, and AFB stain and culture

  - Non-​purulent heparinized samples for `pH` (never put purulent samples in the arterial blood analyser)

  - Consider measurement of cholesterol, triglycerides, chylomicrons, haematocrit, and amylase, depending on the clinical circumstances

- No need for a routine CXR following aspiration, unless difficulties were encountered during the procedure

- If unable to obtain fluid, re-​ultrasound to confirm depth and conformation of fluid, and consider CT-​guided aspiration.

## Therapeutic thoracentesis

- In most cases, can be performed as a day-​case procedure.

- Verify the insertion site using `US`;

- Local anaesthetic infiltration is identical to that of diagnostic thoracentesis.

- Always ensure that fluid is first obtained with a `green` (21G) needle

- Carefully advance an intravenous (IV) `cannula` (with a syringe on the end) along the anaesthetized track

- When fluid is aspirated, remove the inner needle while fully inserting the plastic cannula. Attach the cannula to a `three-​way tap`

- Aspirate fluid from the chest with a 50 mL syringe via the three-​way tap, and flush the fluid into a `sterile jug` through `extension tubing` (e.g. a blood giving set, cut using sterile scissors).

- Often, having ‘primed’ the tubing with pleural fluid, further syringe aspiration is not required, as the fluid siphons down out of the chest itself into the jug.

- Drain a `maximum of 1.5 L` of fluid on one occasion (risk of re-​expansion pulmonary oedema following sudden removal of large volumes).

- Stop the procedure if `resistance` is felt or the patient experiences `discomfort` or `severe coughing`

- Some physicians use pleural manometry to determine a maximum amount to drain

- Apply dressing to aspiration site

- `CXR post-​procedure` is helpful in evaluating for non-​expandable ‘trapped’ lung.
