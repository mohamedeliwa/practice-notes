# Bradycardia


The immediate management tends to relate more to cause and adverse signs than to the underlying rhythm, which may be 
- Sinus bradycardia
- Heart block
- AF with a slow ventricular response
- Atrial flutter with a high-degree block
- Junctional bradycardia


<mark> Think ahead. If you may need an anesthetist to sedate the patient for transcutaneous
pacing, or a cardiologist for transvenous pacing, call them now </mark>


## Investigations

- `ECG`
- `Electrolytes` (including K+, Ca2+, Mg2+)
- `Digoxin` levels
- `Cardiac monitor`

## Management

- `Oxygen` if hypoxic
- Manual `BP`
- `IV access`
- `ECG`
- Identify reversible causes e.g. electrolyte abnormalities
- Check `Adverse signs` (e.g. Shock, Syncope, Heart failure, Myocardial ischemia)
- **If There are no adverse signs**
- Check if there is a risk of asystole (e.g. Recent asystole, Mobitz II AV block, Complete heart block with broad QRS, Ventricular pause >3s)
- **If There is no risk of asystole**
- Continue observation
- **If there are adverse signs** or **Risk of asystole**
- `Atropine` 500mcg IV
- **If there is no satisfactory response**
- Repeat `atropine` 500mcg IV every 3–5mins (max 3mg)
- `Transcutaneous pacing`
- **If pacing is not immediately available**
- `Isoprenaline` 5mcg/min IVI
- `Adrenaline` 2–10mcg/min IV
- Alternatives are: `aminophylline`, `dopamine`, `glucagon` (if bradycardia caused by beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker)
- **If still no satisfactory response**
- `Transvenous pacing`
- **If there is a satisfactory response**
- Continue observation
