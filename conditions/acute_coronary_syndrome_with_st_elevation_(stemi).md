# Acute coronary syndrome—with ST-elevation (STEMI)


### Investigations

- `ECG`
- `Cardiac monitor`
- `Troponin`
-  `CBC` 
- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Glucose`
- `Cholesterol`
- `CXR`

## Initial Management

- Attach `ECG monitor`
- `IV access`
- `Aspirin`: 300mg oral (if not already given);
- `Ticagrelor`: 180mg oral or `prasugrel`(60mg oral if no history of stroke/TIA and <75yrs) as newer alternatives to `clopidogrel` (300mg oral) as they have been shown to be superior in outcome studies.
- `Morphine`: 5–10mg IV (repeat after 5min if necessary).
- Give anti-emetic with the 1st dose of morphine:
	- `Metoclopramide` 10mg IV (1st line)
	- `Cyclizine` 50mg IV (2nd line).
- `Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)`: routine use now not recommended in the acute setting
	- Unless patient is hypertensive or in acute LVF.
	- Useful as anti-anginal in chronic/stable patients.
- `Oxygen` is recommended if patients are
	- SaO2 <95%
	- Breathless
	- Acute LVF
- Restore coronary perfusion in those presenting <12h after symptom onset
- `Anticoagulation` An injectable anticoagulant must be used in primary PCI
	- `Bivalirudin` is preferred, if not available use `enoxaparin` ± a  glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa blocker
- `ß-blockers` provide additional benefit when started early, e.g. `bisoprolol` 2.5mg orally once daily
	- Ensure no evidence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, asthma/COPD, or heart block.
- In case of `Right ventricular infarction`
	- Treat hypotension and oliguria with `fluids`
	- Avoid nitrates and diuretics
	- Monitor `BP` assess early signs of pulmonary oedema
	- Intensive monitoring and `inotropes` may be useful in some patients

## Reperfusion therapy

Look for Typical clinical symptoms of MI plus ECG criteria:
- `ST elevation` >1mm in ≥2 adjacent limb leads
- Or >2mm in ≥2 adjacent chest leads
- `LBBB` (unless known to have LBBB previously).
- Posterior changes: deep ST depression and tall R waves in leads V1 to V3.

### Primary PCI

<mark>Should be offered to all patients presenting within 12h of symptom onset with a STEMI</mark>

If this is not possible, patients should receive `thrombolysis` and be transferred to a primary PCI center  <mark> after the infusion </mark> for either rescue PCI (if residual ST elevation) or `angiography` (if successful).


Offer PCI beyond 12h if
- Evidence of ongoing ischemia 
- Or in stable patients presenting after 12–24h may be appropriate—seek specialist advice.

### Thrombolysis

<mark> Benefit reduces steadily from onset of pain, target time is less than 30min from admission </mark>

<mark> use >12h from symptom onset requires specialist advice. </mark>

<mark> Do not thrombolyse ST depression alone, T-wave inversion alone, or normal ECG. </mark>


- `Tissue plasminogen activators` e.g. `tenecteplase` as a single IV bolus.
- Contraindications
	- Previous intracranial hemorrhage
	- Ischemic stroke <6months
	- Cerebral malignancy or AVM
	- Recent major trauma/surgery/head injury (<3wks)
	- GI bleeding (<1 month)
	- Known bleeding disorder
	- Aortic dissection
	- Non-compressible punctures <24h, e.g. liver biopsy, lumbar puncture
- Relative CI
	- TIA <6 months
	- Anticoagulant therapy
	- Pregnancy/<1wk post partum
	- Refractory hypertension (>180mmHg/110mmHg)
	- Advanced liver disease
	- Infective endocarditis
	- Active peptic ulcer
	- Prolonged/traumatic resuscitation.


<mark> Patients with STEMI who do not receive reperfusion should be treated with fondaparinux, or enoxaparin/unfractionated heparin if not available. </mark>


## Secondary Prevention

- `Aspirin` (75mg once daily) and a second antiplatelet agent (e.g. `clopidogrel`) for at least 12 months
- PPI (e.g. `lansoprazole`) for gastric protection
- Anticoagulant e.g. with `fondaparinux`, until discharge
- `ß-blockers` reduces myocardial oxygen demand
	- Start low and increase slowly, monitoring pulse and BP
	- If contraindicated, consider `verapamil` or `diltiazem`
- `ACE-i` in patients with LV dysfunction, hypertension, or diabetes
	- If not tolerated, consider `ARB`
	- Titrate up slowly, monitoring renal function
- High-dose statin, e.g. `atorvastatin` 80mg
- `Eplerenone` improves outcomes in MI patients with heart failure (ejection fraction <40%)
	- Do an `echo` to assess LV function
