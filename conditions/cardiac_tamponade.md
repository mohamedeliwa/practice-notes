# Cardiac tamponade

Pericardial fluid accumulates, causing an increase in intrapericardial pressure, which prevents the heart from filling properly and ultimately stops its pumping function.

## Management

<mark>If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.</mark>

- Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU.

## Investigations

- `BP`: reduced
- `JVP`: increased
- `Muffled heart sounds`
- `JVP`: increased on inspiration
- `Pulsus paradoxus` (pulse fades on inspiration)
- `Echo` may be diagnostic
- `CXR`: 
	- Globular heart
	- Left heart border convex or straight
	- Right cardio-phrenic angle <90°.
- `ECG`: electrical alternans

## Treatment

- `Prompt pericardiocentesis` brings swift relief.
- Give `O2` target arterial saturations of 94–98% (88–92% if COPD)
- Monitor `ECG`
- `Blood group` (ABO and Rh type)
	- Storing the blood sample so it can be `cross-matched`  if a transfusion is required
- Set up `IVI`
- There may be a role for `cardiothoracic surgery` as a definitive solution to some causes.
