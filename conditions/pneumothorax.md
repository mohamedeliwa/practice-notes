# Pneumothorax

## Investigations

- `CXR`: expiratory film (should not be performed if a tension pneumothorax is suspected)
- `ABG` in dyspneic/hypoxic patients and those with chronic lung disease

## Management

- Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires a chest drain.

### Tension pneumothorax

- `Insert a large-bore cannula`, into the 2nd intercostal interspace in the midclavicular line on the side of the suspected pneumothorax.
- Do this `before requesting a CXR`.
- Then insert a `chest drain`.

### Primary pneumothorax

- If there is no SOB and/or rim of air <2cm on CXR
- Consider discharge and outpatient review in 2–4wks
- If there is SOB and/or rim of air >2cm on CXR
- `Aspiration`
- If successful, consider discharge and outpatient review in 2–4wks
- If failed, `Chest drain`

### Secondary pneumothorax

- If there is SOB or rim of air >2cm on CXR
- `Chest drain`
- If there is no SOB and rim of air 1–2cm on CXR
- `Aspiration`
- If successful, admit for 24h observation and O2
- If failed, `chest drain`
- If Size < 1cm, `Admit` for 24h observation and O2

### Surgical advice: Arrange if:

- Bilateral pneumothoraces
- Lung fails to expand within 48h of intercostal drain insertion;
- Persistent air leak;
- Two or more previous pneumothoraces on the same side; or history of pneumothorax on the opposite side.
