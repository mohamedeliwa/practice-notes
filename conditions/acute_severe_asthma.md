# Acute severe asthma

## Investigations

- `CBC`
- `ABG` if saturations <92% or life-threatening features.
- `CXR` (if suspicion of pneumothorax, infection or life-threatening attack).
- `Urea and creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`

## Treatment

### Immediate treatment

- `O2` to maintain sats between 94–98%.
- `Salbutamol` 5mg (or terbutaline 10mg) nebulized with O2.
- If severe/life-threatening add `ipratropium` 0.5mg/6h.
- `Hydrocortisone` 100mg IV or `prednisolone` 40–50mg oral.

### Reassess every 15 minutes

- If no or little improvement
- `Salbutamol` nebulizers every 15–30min, or 10mg/h continuously.
- Add `ipratropium` if not already given
- Monitor ECG; watch for arrhythmias
- Consider single dose of `magnesium sulfate` (MgSO4) 1.2–2g IV over 20min
  in those with severe/life-threatening features without good initial response to therapy

### If improving within 15–30min

- Nebulized `salbutamol` every 4–6h (+ ipratropium if started in previous step)
- `Prednisolone` 40–50mg oral, once daily for 5–7 days
- Monitor O2 sats, aim 94–98% with supplemental if needed
- If good improvement 1h after initial treatment, consider discharge with outpatient follow-up

### If not improving

- Refer to ICU if any of the following signs are present:
  - Hypercapnia
  - Persistent/worsening hypoxia
  - ABG showing low pH or high H+
  - Exhaustion, feeble respiration
  - Drowsiness, confusion, altered
    conscious level
  - Respiratory arrest
