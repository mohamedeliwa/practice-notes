# Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)

The volume inside the cranium is ﬁxed, so any increase in the contents can lead to
raised ICP. This can be mass effect, oedema, or obstruction to ﬂuid outﬂow. Normal
ICP in adults is <15mmHg.

**Causes**
• Primary or metastatic tumours.
• Head injury.
• Haemorrhage (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular).
• Infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess.
• Hydrocephalus.
• Cerebral oedema.
• Status epilepticus.

**Signs and symptoms**
• Headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting.
• Altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma.
• History of trauma.
• reduced HR and increased BP (Cushing’s response); Cheyne–Stokes respiration.
• Pupil changes (constriction at ﬁrst, later dilation—do not mask these signs by using
agents such as tropicamide to dilate the pupil to aid fundoscopy).
• reduced Visual acuity; peripheral visual ﬁeld loss.
• Papilloedema is an unreliable sign, but venous pulsation at the disc may be absent
(absent in ~50% of normal people, but loss of it is a useful sign).
Investigations
• U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture.
• Consider toxicology screen.
• CXR—any source of infection that might indicate abscess?
• CT head.
• Then consider LP if safe. Measure the opening pressure!

**Management** See ﬁg 19.22. The goal is to reduced ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent
neurosurgery is required for the deﬁnitive treatment of increased ICP from focal causes (eg
haematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or
bolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in ﬁg 19.22.

**Herniation syndromes**

**Uncal herniation** is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsi-
lateral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against
the midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a
dilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a ﬁxed pupil localizes a lesion poorly
but is ‘ipsilateralizing’). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis
(pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending re-
ticular activating system (ARAS) in the midbrain.

**Cerebellar tonsil herniation** is caused by increased pressure in the posterior fossa forcing
the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and
upgoing plantar reﬂexes occur ﬁrst, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing,
and apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and
poor compliance in, the posterior fossa.

**Subfalcian (cingulate) herniation** is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus
(medial frontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the
anterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke—eg contralateral leg
weakness ± abulia (lack of decision-making).
