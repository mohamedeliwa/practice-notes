# Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)


**Definition:**
Raised ICP occurs when the volume inside the cranium increases, which can be due to mass effect (e.g., tumors), edema, or obstruction to fluid outflow. Normal ICP in adults is <15mmHg.

### **Causes of Raised ICP:**

1. **Primary or metastatic brain tumors**
2. **Head injury**
3. **Haemorrhage** (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular)
4. **Infections** (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess)
5. **Hydrocephalus**
6. **Cerebral oedema**
7. **Status epilepticus**

### **Signs and Symptoms:**

- **Headache** (worsens with coughing, leaning forward)
- **Vomiting**
- **Altered consciousness** (drowsiness, irritability, coma)
- **History of trauma**
- **Cushing’s response** (reduced heart rate, increased blood pressure)
- **Cheyne–Stokes respiration**
- **Pupil changes**: Initially constriction, later dilation
- **Visual changes**: Reduced acuity, peripheral field loss
- **Papilloedema** (less reliable, but absence of venous pulsation at the disc may be notable)
- **Abnormal GCS scores**

### **Investigations:**

8. **Laboratory tests:**
    - U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood cultures
    - Consider a **toxicology screen** if needed
9. **CXR:** Check for infection (abscess)
10. **CT Head Scan:** Crucial for identifying structural causes (e.g., mass lesions, hemorrhage)
11. **Lumbar Puncture (LP):** Measure opening pressure, if deemed safe

### **Management Algorithm:**

12. **Initial Goal:** Reduce ICP and prevent secondary injury.
13. **Urgent Neurosurgical Intervention:**
    - **For focal causes** (e.g., hematomas), perform **craniotomy or burr hole**.
    - **ICP monitoring:** Place an ICP monitor/bolt to assess pressure.
14. **Other Supportive Measures:**
    - Head elevation, sedation, hyperventilation, osmotic agents (e.g., mannitol), and corticosteroids may be used as holding measures to lower ICP.

### **Herniation Syndromes:**

15. **Uncal Herniation:**
    - Caused by lateral supratentorial mass pushing the temporal lobe (uncus) against the midbrain.
    - Symptoms: Dilated ipsilateral pupil, ophthalmoplegia, contralateral hemiparesis, coma.
16. **Cerebellar Tonsil Herniation:**
    - Caused by posterior fossa pressure forcing cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.
    - Symptoms: Ataxia, VIth nerve palsy, upgoing plantar reflex, followed by unconsciousness, irregular breathing, apnea.
17. **Subfalcian (Cingulate) Herniation:**
    - Caused by frontal mass forcing the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri.
    - Symptoms: May be silent or lead to stroke, contralateral leg weakness, abulia (lack of decision-making).

### **Key Points:**

- **Urgency:** Rapid assessment and intervention are critical, especially in cases of mass effect (e.g., hematomas) or herniation syndromes.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous ICP monitoring is important in managing raised ICP, especially for patients undergoing surgical intervention.
