# Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)


The volume inside the cranium is ﬁxed, so any increase in the contents can lead to
raised ICP. This can be mass effect, edema, or obstruction to ﬂuid outﬂow. Normal
ICP in adults is <15mmHg.

## **Investigations**

- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`
- `CBC`
- `Liver Function Tests` 
- `Glucose`
- `Serum osmolality` 
- `Clotting`
- `Blood cultures`
- Consider a `toxicology screen`  if needed
- `CXR`: Check for infection (abscess)
- `CT` Head Scan: Crucial for identifying structural causes (e.g., mass lesions, hemorrhage)
- `Lumbar Puncture` (LP): Measure opening pressure, (if safe)

## **Management**

1. **Initial Goal:** Reduce ICP and prevent secondary injury.
2. **Urgent Neurosurgical Intervention:**
    - **For focal causes** (e.g., hematomas), perform **craniotomy or burr hole**.
    - **ICP monitoring:** Place an ICP monitor/bolt to assess pressure.
3. **Other Supportive Measures:**
    - Head elevation, sedation, hyperventilation, osmotic agents (e.g., mannitol), and corticosteroids may be used as holding measures to lower ICP.

### **Herniation Syndromes:**

4. **Uncal Herniation:**
    - Caused by lateral supratentorial mass pushing the temporal lobe (uncus) against the midbrain.
    - Symptoms: Dilated ipsilateral pupil, ophthalmoplegia, contralateral hemiparesis, coma.
5. **Cerebellar Tonsil Herniation:**
    - Caused by posterior fossa pressure forcing cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.
    - Symptoms: Ataxia, VIth nerve palsy, upgoing plantar reflex, followed by unconsciousness, irregular breathing, apnea.
6. **Subfalcian (Cingulate) Herniation:**
    - Caused by frontal mass forcing the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri.
    - Symptoms: May be silent or lead to stroke, contralateral leg weakness, abulia (lack of decision-making).

### **Key Points:**

- **Urgency:** Rapid assessment and intervention are critical, especially in cases of mass effect (e.g., hematomas) or herniation syndromes.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous ICP monitoring is important in managing raised ICP, especially for patients undergoing surgical intervention.
