# Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)


The volume inside the cranium is ﬁxed, so any increase in the contents can lead to
raised ICP. This can be mass effect, edema, or obstruction to ﬂuid outﬂow. Normal
ICP in adults is <15mmHg.

## **Investigations**

- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`
- `CBC`
- `Liver Function Tests` 
- `Glucose`
- `Serum osmolality` 
- `Clotting`
- `Blood cultures`
- Consider a `toxicology screen`  if needed
- `CXR`: Check for infection (abscess)
- `CT` Head Scan: Crucial for identifying structural causes (e.g., mass lesions, hemorrhage)
- `Lumbar Puncture` (LP): Measure opening pressure, (if safe)

## **Management**

The goal is to reduce ICP and prevent secondary injury.

1. `ABC`
2. `Correct hypotension`, maintain `MAP >90mmHg`
3. `Treat seizures`
4. Brief `examination`; `history` if available
5. `Elevate the head` of the bed to 30–40°
6. If intubated, `hyperventilate` to `reduce PaCO2 (aim 3.5–4kPa)`, This causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP almost immediately. 
7. Maintain `PaO2 >90mmHg`
8. Osmotic agents (e.g. `mannitol`) can be useful but may lead to rebound ICP after prolonged use (~12–24h)
9. `Mannitol` 20% solution 0.25–0.5g/kg IV over 10–20min (e.g. 5mL/kg)
	- Effect is seen after ~20min and lasts for 2–6h.
	- Follow serum `osmolality`—aim for about 300 mosmol/kg but don’t exceed 310
10. `Corticosteroids` are not effective in reducing ICP except for oedema surrounding tumours 
	- `Dexamethasone` 10mg IV and follow with 4mg/6h IV/PO
11. Consider other measures, e.g. sedation, anti-epileptics, therapeutic hypothermia
12. `Restrict ﬂuid` to <1.5L/d
13. Monitor the patient closely; consider `monitoring ICP`
14. Start to make a diagnosis
15. Treat cause or exacerbating factors, e.g. hyperglycemia, hyponatremia
16. Deﬁnitive treatment if possible
17. If focal causes (e.g. hematomas): Urgent neurosurgery is required for the deﬁnitive treatment of increased ICP.
