# Invasive Mechanical Ventilation

The requirement for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is the most common indication for admission to the ICU.

The most common reason for mechanical ventilation is hypoxic respiratory failure (type 1 respiratory failure).  
In addition, patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure (type II respiratory failure) who have failed non-invasive modes of ventilation (NIV) require mechanical ventilation.

## Basic Modes of Ventilation

- Volume Assist-Control Mode (VAC).
- Pressure Assist-Control Mode (PAC).
- Pressure Support Ventilation Mode (PSV).
- Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV).

## Initial ventilator settings

| Setting   |               |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Mode      | VAC or PAC    |
| VT        | 6–8 mL/kg-PBW |
| Rate      | 12–16 min     |
| PEEP      | 5 cm H2O      |
| FiO2      | 80 %          |
| Flow rate | 40–80 L/min   |
| Waveform  | Decelerating  |

These setting should then be dynamically adjusted according to:

- Keep Plateau pressures less than 30 cm H2O (unless stiff chest wall disorder is
  present, i.e. kyphoscoliosis, morbid obesity, increased abdominal pressures,
  neuromuscular disease)
- Arterial saturation-pulse oximetry (90–92%)
- pH and pCO2
- PEEPi (intrinsic PEEP)
- Flow and Pressure waveforms

Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio (I:E)

- For most adults, a normal I:E ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 is used.
- In patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and asthma, longer I:E ratios (>1:4) are necessary to allow the lungs time to exhale to resting functional residual capacity (FRC) and to avoid hyperinfl ation.
- Patients who are hypoxemic secondary to ARDS require increased mean airway pressure (mPaw) to increase the FRC and allow more surface area for gas transfer to occur. This is achieved using both PEEP and inverse ratio ventilation. In addition, studies have demonstrated that prolonging inspiration can result in a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation within abnormal lungs. When the I:E ratio is increased to 1:1 or more, the inspiratory pressure is maintained for a longer period of time, however, the peak inspiratory pressure does not increase.

Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)

- In patients with a large shunt increasing FiO 2 has little effect on arterial PaO2; increased PEEP is required to increase PaO2 in patients with a large shunt.
- It should be noted that PEEP is “good” for left ventricular function but may cause cardiovascular collapse in patients with severe right ventricular dysfunction.
- Some clinicians use “physiological” or prophylactic PEEP (5 cm H2O) to prevent atelectasis/pneumonia.
- Increased PEEP (>5 cm H2O) is primarily used in patients’ with pulmonary edema (non-cardiogenic and cardiogenic) with a large intra-pulmonary shunt who become refractory to increasing FiO2 .
- It has been reported that in patients with ARDS a mean PEEP level of 15 cm H2O is required to sustain alveolar opening at end-expiration
