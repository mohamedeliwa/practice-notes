# Invasive Mechanical Ventilation

The requirement for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is the most common indication for admission to the ICU.

The most common indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation are
listed below:

- Hypoxic respiratory failure
  - Deliver a high FiO2
  - Reduce shunt
  - Apply PEEP
- Hypercapnic respiratory acidosis
  - Reduce the work of breathing (WOB) and thus prevents respiratory muscle
    fatigue
  - Maintain adequate alveolar ventilation
- Unprotected and unstable airways (e.g., coma)
  - Secure the airway
  - Reduce the risk of aspiration
  - Maintain adequate alveolar ventilation
- Other
  - To facilitate procedure (bronchoscopy), bronchial suctioning

## Basic Modes of Ventilation

- Volume Assist-Control Mode (VAC).
- Pressure Assist-Control Mode (PAC).
- Pressure Support Ventilation Mode (PSV).
- Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV).

## Initial ventilator settings

| Setting   |               |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Mode      | VAC or PAC    |
| Vt        | 6–8 mL/kg-PBW |
| Rate      | 12–16 min     |
| PEEP      | 5 cm H2O      |
| FiO2      | 80 %          |
| Flow rate | 40–80 L/min   |
| Waveform  | Decelerating  |

These setting should then be dynamically adjusted according to:

- Keep Plateau pressures less than 30 cm H2O (unless stiff chest wall disorder is
  present, i.e. kyphoscoliosis, morbid obesity, increased abdominal pressures,
  neuromuscular disease)
- Arterial saturation-pulse oximetry (90–92%)
- pH and pCO2
- PEEPi (intrinsic PEEP)
- Flow and Pressure waveforms

### The predicted body weight (PBW)

should be calculated on all patients undergoing mechanical ventilation

- Men: PBW = 50.0 + 0.91 (height in centimeters—152.4)
- Women: PBW = 45.5 + 0.91 (height in centimeters—152.4)

### Tidal Volume (Vt)

- the Vt of all patients undergoing mechanical ventilation should target 6 mL/kg PBW and should never exceed 8 mL/kg PBW.
- Alveolar Overdistension Damages Normal Lungs
- a large Vt and high peak airway pressure were independently associated with development of ARDS in patients who did not have ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation

### Ventilator Trigger Variables

- Pressure triggering, is a set negative pressure (relative to PEEP), and is commonly set at −2 cm H2O.
- Flow triggering, flow rate trigger is usually set between 1 and 4 L/min.
- the inspiratory muscle work is significantly higher with pressure-triggered CPAP (without PSV) than with flow-triggered CPAP.
- However, pressure support of 5 cm H2O, reduces the inspiratory muscle work of pressure-triggered CPAP to a level comparable with that of flow-triggered CPAP
- The goal is to reduce the trigger sensitivity as much as possible in attempt to minimize the patient work to trigger without creating inadvertent ventilator auto-triggering.

### Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio (I:E)

- For most adults, a normal I:E ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 is used.
- COPD and asthma patients, longer I:E ratios (>1:4) are necessary to allow the lungs time to exhale to resting functional residual capacity (FRC) and to avoid hyperinflation.
- Hypoxemic patients secondary to ARDS require increased mean airway pressure (mPaw) to increase the FRC and allow more surface area for gas transfer to occur. This is achieved using both PEEP and inverse ratio ventilation. In addition, studies have demonstrated that prolonging inspiration can result in a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation within abnormal lungs. When the I:E ratio is increased to 1:1 or more, the inspiratory pressure is maintained for a longer period of time, however, the peak inspiratory pressure does not increase.

### Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)

- In patients with a large shunt increasing FiO2 has little effect on arterial PaO2; increased PEEP is required to increase PaO2 in patients with a large shunt.
- It should be noted that PEEP is “good” for left ventricular function but may cause cardiovascular collapse in patients with severe right ventricular dysfunction.
- Some clinicians use “physiological” or prophylactic PEEP (5 cm H2O) to prevent atelectasis/pneumonia.
- Increased PEEP (>5 cm H2O) is primarily used in patients’ with pulmonary edema (non-cardiogenic and cardiogenic) with a large intra-pulmonary shunt who become refractory to increasing FiO2 .
- It has been reported that in patients with ARDS a mean PEEP level of 15 cm H2O is required to sustain alveolar opening at end-expiration
- A PSV of between 5 and 10 cm H 2 O will overcome the resistance of the ventilator circuit and endotracheal tube.

Indications for PEEP

- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Acute lung injury and ARDS
- Postoperative patients (decreased FRC)
- Prevent basal atelectasis in morbidly obese patients

Contraindications

- Bullous lung disease and emphysema
- Unilateral lung disease (relative contra-indication)  
  PEEP valve: When using >5 cm H2O PEEP, a PEEP valve should be used when  
  suctioning the patient. Disconnecting the endotracheal tube will result in a loss of  
  PEEP, a rapid reduction in the FRC, and alveolar flooding.

### Auto-PEEP

- Patients may present with hemodynamic collapse similar to that of a tension pneumothorax.
- Auto-PEEP is treated by disconnecting the patient from the ventilator to “vent” the trapped air, and then changing the I:E ratio, allowing more time for exhalation.
- The presence of auto-PEEP cannot be detected unless the exhalation port venting to the atmosphere is occluded at end expiration (using a one-way valve). Some ventilators have an expiratory hold valve, enabling the auto-PEEP to be measured directly.
