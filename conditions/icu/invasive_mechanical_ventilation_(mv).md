# Invasive Mechanical Ventilation

The requirement for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is the most common indication for admission to the ICU.

The most common indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation are listed below:

- Hypoxic respiratory failure
  - Deliver a high FiO₂
  - Reduce shunt
  - Apply PEEP
- Hypercapnic respiratory acidosis
  - ↓ the work of breathing (WOB) and thus prevents respiratory muscle fatigue
  - Maintain adequate alveolar ventilation
- Unprotected and unstable airways (e.g., coma)
  - Secure the airway
  - ↓ the risk of aspiration
  - Maintain adequate alveolar ventilation
- Other
  - To facilitate procedure (bronchoscopy), bronchial suctioning

## Basic Modes of Ventilation

- Volume Assist-Control Mode (VAC).
- Pressure Assist-Control Mode (PAC).
- Pressure Support Ventilation Mode (PSV).
- Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV).

## Initial ventilator settings

| Setting   |               |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Mode      | VAC or PAC    |
| Vt        | 6–8 mL/kg-PBW |
| Rate      | 12–16 min     |
| PEEP      | 5 cm H₂O      |
| FiO₂      | 80 %          |
| Flow rate | 40–80 L/min   |
| Waveform  | Decelerating  |

These setting should then be dynamically adjusted according to:

- Keep Plateau pressures < `30 cm H₂O` (unless stiff chest wall disorder is
  present, i.e. kyphoscoliosis, morbid obesity, increased abdominal pressures,
  neuromuscular disease)
- Arterial saturation-pulse oximetry (`90–92%`)
- pH and pCO2
- PEEPi (intrinsic PEEP)
- Flow and Pressure waveforms

### The predicted body weight (PBW)

should be calculated on all patients undergoing mechanical ventilation

- Men: PBW = `50.0 + 0.91 \* (height in centimeters - 152.4)`
- Women: PBW = `45.5 + 0.91 \* (height in centimeters - 152.4)`

### Tidal Volume (Vt)

- the Vt of all patients should target `6 mL/kg PBW` and should never exceed `8 mL/kg PBW`.
- Alveolar Overdistension Damages Normal Lungs
- a ↑ Vt and ↑ peak airway pressure were independently associated with development of `ARDS` in patients who did not have ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation
- If there is a significant `↓ in the measured Vt` compared with the set Vt, one needs to check for leaks in the ventilator circuit, including the cuff and tubing.
- Patients with a `chest tube` may also have ↓ measured Vt if there is a lung leak and a portion of the Vt is lost through the chest tube (e.g., in bronchopleural fistula).
- In pressure modes (PAC, PSV), `a ↓ measured Vt` may indicate ↑ airway resistance or ↓ lung compliance or both. e.g. bronchospasm, mucus plugging, barotrauma, or pulmonary edema.
- `Migration of the endotracheal tube` into the right mainstem bronchus may also reduce Vt because it reduces lung compliance.

### Respiratory Rate (RR)

- `Tachypnea` in a patient who is previously stable may be associated with anxiety, worsening of respiratory conditions, development of complications (e.g., nosocomial pneumonia, sepsis, acute lung injury, fever), or inappropriate ventilator settings.

- A `↓ RR` usually is associated with loss of respiratory drive, as seen in deep sedation or the development of acute neurologic events.

- In these situations, a `backup rate` may be added to ensure minimum Minute Ventilation (VE) in case the patient develops apnea. This is especially important if the patient is receiving only `PSV`.

### Oxygenation

- Keep PaO₂ `≥ 60 mmHg` and an O₂ saturation of at least 90%.
- When the `PaO₂ ↓ acutely`, one should look for causes of ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt.

### Inspiratory flow rate

- In volume modes (VAC and IMV), the PIFR is usually set at `40 to 90 L/minute`.
- `↑ IFR` result in ↑ Paw, which may trigger high-pressure alarms.
- If this happens or if the patient is still not comfortable, one can try pressure modes (PAC or PSV).
- The pressure modes usually provide much higher initial inspiratory flow than the volume modes while limiting the airway pressure.
- `A decelerating flow pattern` is associated with lower inspiratory pressure.

### Paw and Pplat

- In volume modes, `↑ Paw` is associated with ↑ airway resistance or ↓ respiratory system compliance
- In pressure modes, because pressures are limited, changes in airway resistance or respiratory system compliance are not associated with airway pressure changes. Rather, the Vt will reduce

### Ventilator Trigger Variables

- Pressure triggering, is a set negative pressure (relative to PEEP), and is commonly set at `−0.5 to −2 cm H₂O`.
- Flow triggering, flow rate trigger is usually set between `1 and 4 L/min`.
- The inspiratory muscle work is significantly higher with pressure-triggered CPAP (without PSV) than with flow-triggered CPAP.
- However, pressure support of `5 cm H₂O`, reduces the inspiratory muscle work of pressure-triggered CPAP to a level comparable with that of flow-triggered CPAP
- The goal is to reduce the trigger sensitivity as much as possible in attempt to minimize the patient work to trigger without creating inadvertent ventilator auto-triggering.

### Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio (I:E)

- For most adults, a normal I:E ratio of `1:2 or 1:3` is used.
- `COPD and asthma` patients, longer I:E ratios (`>1:4`) are necessary to allow the lungs time to exhale to resting functional residual capacity (FRC) and to avoid hyperinflation.
- Hypoxemic patients secondary to `ARDS` require ↑ mean airway pressure (mPaw) to increase the FRC and allow more surface area for gas transfer to occur. This is achieved using both `PEEP and inverse ratio ventilation`. In addition, studies have demonstrated that prolonging inspiration can result in a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation within abnormal lungs. When the I:E ratio is increased to `1:1` or more, the inspiratory pressure is maintained for a longer period of time, however, the peak inspiratory pressure does not increase.

### Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)

- In patients with a large shunt increasing FiO₂ has little effect on arterial PaO2; `↑ PEEP` is required to increase PaO₂ in patients with a large shunt.
- It should be noted that PEEP is “good” for `left ventricular function` but may cause cardiovascular collapse in patients with `severe right ventricular dysfunction`.
- Some clinicians use “physiological” or prophylactic PEEP (`5 cm H₂O`) to prevent atelectasis/pneumonia.
- ↑ PEEP (`>5 cm H₂O`) is primarily used in patients’ with `pulmonary edema` (non-cardiogenic and cardiogenic) with a large intra-pulmonary shunt who become refractory to increasing FiO₂ .
- It has been reported that in patients with `ARDS` a mean PEEP level of `15 cm H₂O` is required to sustain alveolar opening at end-expiration
- A `PSV` of between `5 and 10 cm H₂O` will overcome the resistance of the ventilator circuit and endotracheal tube.

Indications for PEEP

- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Acute lung injury and ARDS
- Postoperative patients (decreased FRC)
- Prevent basal atelectasis in morbidly obese patients

Contraindications

- Bullous lung disease and emphysema
- Unilateral lung disease (relative contra-indication)

PEEP valve

- When using `>5 cm H₂O` PEEP, a PEEP valve should be used when  
  suctioning the patient.
- Disconnecting the endotracheal tube will result in a loss of PEEP, a rapid reduction in the FRC, and alveolar flooding.

### Auto-PEEP

- Patients may present with `hemodynamic collapse` similar to that of a tension pneumothorax.
- Auto-PEEP is `treated by` disconnecting the patient from the ventilator to “vent” the trapped air, and then changing the I:E ratio, allowing more time for exhalation.
- The presence of auto-PEEP cannot be detected unless the exhalation port venting to the atmosphere is occluded at end expiration (using a one-way valve). Some ventilators have an `expiratory hold valve`, enabling the auto-PEEP to be measured directly.
