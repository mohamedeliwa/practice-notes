# Severe pulmonary oedema

<mark> Begin treatment before investigations </mark>
## Investigations

- `CXR`: cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary oedema: look for shadowing (usually bilateral), small effusions at costophrenic angles, fluid in the lung fissures, and Kerley B lines (septal linear opacities).
- `ECG`: signs of MI, dysrhythmias.
- `Urea`& `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes` 
- `Troponin`
- `ABG`
- `Echo`.
- `BNP`  may be helpful if diagnosis in question (high negative predictive value).

## Monitor

- `BP`
- `Pulse`
- `Cyanosis`
- `Respiratory rate`
- `JVP`
- `Urine output`
- `ABG`
- Observe on `cardiac monitor`.
## Management

- Sit the patient upright
- `Oxygen`: High-flow  if reduced SpO2
- IV access 
- Monitor ECG: Treat any arrhythmias
- Investigations whilst continuing treatment
- `Diamorphine` 1.25–5mg IV slowly Caution in liver failure and COPD
- `Furosemide` 40–80mg IV slowly Larger doses required in renal failure
- `GTN`: 2 x 0.3mg tablets SL or spray 2 puffs SL  (Don’t give if systolic BP <90mmHg)
- Necessary investigations, examination, and history
- `Nitrate infusion`: If systolic BP ≥100mmHg, (e.g. `isosorbide dinitrate` 2–10mg/h IVI), keep systolic BP ≥90mmHg
- If the patient is worsening
- Further dose of `furosemide` 40–80mg
- Consider `CPAP`: improves ventilation, driving fluid out of alveolar spaces
- Increase `nitrate` infusion (if able to do so without dropping systolic BP <100mmHg)
- Consider `alternative diagnoses` (e.g. hypertensive heart failure, aortic dissection,
pulmonary embolism, pneumonia)

<mark> If systolic BP less than 100mmHg, treat as cardiogenic shock and refer to ICU </mark>

>Avoid supplemental oxygen if not hypoxaemic since may cause vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac output.
>
 If known COPD, hypoxaemia still needs correcting; give high-flow oxygen but monitor closely for CO2 retention (check serial ABG if needed) and reduce flow as soon as possible.
