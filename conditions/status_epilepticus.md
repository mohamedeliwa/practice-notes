# Status Epilepticus

**Definition:**  
Status epilepticus refers to seizures lasting for more than 30 minutes or repeated seizures without regaining consciousness between them. The risk of mortality and brain damage increases with the duration of the attack. The goal is to stop seizures within 20 minutes.

**Causes:**  
It typically occurs in patients with known epilepsy but can also be the first presentation of a structural brain lesion in over 50% of cases. Non-convulsive status (e.g., absence status or partial seizures with consciousness intact) may be more challenging to diagnose and requires careful observation (e.g., subtle eye or lid movements). Consider eclampsia in pregnant patients and check for other causes like hypoglycemia, alcohol, drugs, or CNS lesions.

### Investigations

1. **Initial bedside tests**:
    
    - Glucose
    - ABG (Arterial Blood Gas)
    - U&E (Urea and Electrolytes)
    - Calcium (Ca²⁺)
    - Full Blood Count (FBC)
    - ECG (Electrocardiogram)
2. **Additional investigations** (once management has started):
    
    - Anticonvulsant levels
    - Toxicology screen
    - Lumbar puncture (LP)
    - Blood and urine cultures
    - EEG (Electroencephalogram)
    - CT scan of the brain
    - Carbon monoxide level
    - Pulse oximetry
    - Cardiac monitoring

### Management

1. **Basic Life Support (BLS) and First-Line Treatment:**
    
    - **Lorazepam**:  
        Administer 0.1 mg/kg (usually 4 mg) as a slow IV bolus. If no response after 10–20 minutes, give a second dose. _Warning_: Be cautious of respiratory arrest during the last part of the injection. Ensure full resuscitation equipment is available.
        
    - **Alternative Routes**:
        
        - **Rectal Diazepam**: If IV access is difficult.
        - **Buccal Midazolam**: For non-IV settings (e.g., in the community):
            - Adults and children over 10 years: 10 mg
            - Children 5–10 years: 7.5 mg
            - Children 1–5 years: 5 mg
2. **Second-Line Treatment (If Seizures Persist):**
    
    - **Phenytoin Infusion**:  
        Administer 15–18 mg/kg IV (e.g., 1g for a 60kg patient). Max rate: 50mg/min. _Warning_: Monitor BP and ECG for potential hypotension or bradycardia.
        - Maintenance dose: 100mg every 6–8 hours.
3. **Seek ICU Help**:  
    If seizures continue, consult ICU for anesthesia and paralysis with medications like propofol. Continuous monitoring is critical, especially for respiratory function. Rule out pseudo-seizures (e.g., pelvic thrusts, resistance to lid opening, abnormal limb movements).
    
4. **Dexamethasone**:  
    If cerebral edema or vasculitis (e.g., tumor) is suspected, administer 10mg IV.
    
5. **After Seizures are Controlled**:  
    Start oral anticonvulsants and identify potential causes (e.g., hypoglycemia, pregnancy, alcohol, CNS infections, or inadequate anticonvulsant dosing/compliance).

### Convulsive Status Epilepticus Management Algorithm

6. **Airway management**:  
    Open and secure the airway. Use adjuncts if necessary. Remove poorly fitting dentures.
    
7. **Oxygenation**:  
    Administer 100% oxygen and suction as needed.
    
8. **IV Access & Blood Tests**:  
    Take blood for U&E, LFT, FBC, glucose, Ca²⁺, and consider toxicology screens and anticonvulsant levels.
    
9. **Initial IV bolus**:  
    Administer **Lorazepam** (4mg IV) to stop the seizures. If no response after 10–20 minutes, administer a second dose.
    
10. **Thiamine & Glucose**:
    
    - Administer 250mg IV thiamine if alcoholism or malnutrition is suspected.
    - If hypoglycemia is present, administer 50mL of 50% glucose IV, unless glucose levels are normal.
11. **Correct Hypotension**:  
    Treat hypotension with IV fluids.
    
12. **Phenytoin Infusion**:  
    If seizures persist, administer phenytoin (15–18mg/kg IV) at a maximum rate of 50mg/min. Monitor ECG and BP.
    
13. **General Anesthesia**:  
    If seizures continue after 60–90 minutes of treatment, escalate care with expert help for paralysis (e.g., propofol infusion) and ventilation. Use continuous EEG monitoring in ICU.  
    _Important_: Never go longer than 20 minutes without assistance from an anesthetist in cases of status epilepticus.
