# Status Epilepticus

Seizures lasting for more than 30 minutes or repeated seizures without regaining consciousness between them. 

The goal is to stop seizures within 20 minutes.

Consider <mark> eclampsia </mark> in pregnant patients and check the `urine` and `BP`: call a senior obstetrician—`immediate delivery may be needed`.

### Investigations

1. **Initial bedside tests**:
    
    - `Random Blood Glucose`
    - `Pulse oximetry`
    - `ABG` 
    - `Urea` & `Creatinine` 
    - Electrolytes
    - `Ca²⁺`
    - CBC
    - `ECG` 
2. **Additional investigations** (once treatment has started):
    
    - `Anticonvulsant levels`
    - `Toxicology` screen
    - `LP`
    - `Blood and urine cultures`
    - `EEG`
    - `CT brain`
    - Carbon monoxide level
    - Cardiac monitoring

### Management

3. **Basic Life Support (BLS) and First-Line Treatment:**
    
    - **Lorazepam**:  
        Administer 0.1 mg/kg (usually 4 mg) as a slow IV bolus. If no response after 10–20 minutes, give a second dose. _Warning_: Be cautious of respiratory arrest during the last part of the injection. Ensure full resuscitation equipment is available.
        
    - **Alternative Routes**:
        
        - **Rectal Diazepam**: If IV access is difficult.
        - **Buccal Midazolam**: For non-IV settings (e.g., in the community):
            - Adults and children over 10 years: 10 mg
            - Children 5–10 years: 7.5 mg
            - Children 1–5 years: 5 mg
4. **Second-Line Treatment (If Seizures Persist):**
    
    - **Phenytoin Infusion**:  
        Administer 15–18 mg/kg IV (e.g., 1g for a 60kg patient). Max rate: 50mg/min. _Warning_: Monitor BP and ECG for potential hypotension or bradycardia.
        - Maintenance dose: 100mg every 6–8 hours.
5. **Seek ICU Help**:  
    If seizures continue, consult ICU for anesthesia and paralysis with medications like propofol. Continuous monitoring is critical, especially for respiratory function. Rule out pseudo-seizures (e.g., pelvic thrusts, resistance to lid opening, abnormal limb movements).
    
6. **Dexamethasone**:  
    If cerebral edema or vasculitis (e.g., tumor) is suspected, administer 10mg IV.
    
7. **After Seizures are Controlled**:  
    Start oral anticonvulsants and identify potential causes (e.g., hypoglycemia, pregnancy, alcohol, CNS infections, or inadequate anticonvulsant dosing/compliance).

### Convulsive Status Epilepticus Management Algorithm

8. **Airway management**:  
    Open and secure the airway. Use adjuncts if necessary. Remove poorly fitting dentures.
    
9. **Oxygenation**:  
    Administer 100% oxygen and suction as needed.
    
10. **IV Access & Blood Tests**:  
    Take blood for U&E, LFT, FBC, glucose, Ca²⁺, and consider toxicology screens and anticonvulsant levels.
    
11. **Initial IV bolus**:  
    Administer **Lorazepam** (4mg IV) to stop the seizures. If no response after 10–20 minutes, administer a second dose.
    
12. **Thiamine & Glucose**:
    
    - Administer 250mg IV thiamine if alcoholism or malnutrition is suspected.
    - If hypoglycemia is present, administer 50mL of 50% glucose IV, unless glucose levels are normal.
13. **Correct Hypotension**:  
    Treat hypotension with IV fluids.
    
14. **Phenytoin Infusion**:  
    If seizures persist, administer phenytoin (15–18mg/kg IV) at a maximum rate of 50mg/min. Monitor ECG and BP.
    
15. **General Anesthesia**:  
    If seizures continue after 60–90 minutes of treatment, escalate care with expert help for paralysis (e.g., propofol infusion) and ventilation. Use continuous EEG monitoring in ICU.  
    _Important_: Never go longer than 20 minutes without assistance from an anesthetist in cases of status epilepticus.
