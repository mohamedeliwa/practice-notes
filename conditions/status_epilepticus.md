# Status Epilepticus

Seizures lasting for more than 30 minutes or repeated seizures without regaining consciousness between them. 

The goal is to stop seizures within 20 minutes.

Consider <mark> eclampsia </mark> in pregnant patients and check the `urine` and `BP`: call a senior obstetrician—`immediate delivery may be needed`.

### Investigations

1. **Initial bedside tests**:
    
    - `Random Blood Glucose`
    - `Pulse oximetry`
    - `ABG` 
    - `Urea` & `Creatinine` 
    - `Electrolytes`
    - `Ca²⁺`
    - `CBC`
    - `ECG` 
2. **Additional investigations** (once treatment has started):
    
    - `Anticonvulsant levels`
    - `Toxicology` screen
    - `LP`
    - `Blood and urine cultures`
    - `EEG`
    - `CT brain`
    - `Carbon monoxide level`
    - `Cardiac monitoring`

### Management

- Basic Life Support
- `Open and secure the airway`. Use adjuncts if necessary. Remove poorly fitting teeth if poorly ﬁtting
- `Oxygen`, 100% + suction (as required)
- `IV access` and take blood tests
- **`Lorazepam`** 0.1 mg/kg (usually 4 mg) as a slow bolus into a large vein.
- If no response after 10–20 minutes, give a second dose.
- `Warning` Be cautious of respiratory arrest during the last part of the injection. Ensure full resuscitation equipment is available.
- **Alternative Routes** If IV access is difficult:        
- `Rectal Diazepam`.
- `Buccal Midazolam`:
	- squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on each side
	- Adults and children over 10 years: 10 mg
	- Children 5–10 years: 7.5 mg
	- Children 1–5 years: 5 mg
- `Thiamine` 250mg IV over 30min if alcoholism or malnourishment suspected
- `Glucose` 50mL 50% IV, unless glucose known to be normal 
- Treat `acidosis` if severe (contact ICU)
- Correct hypotension with `ﬂuids`
- If ﬁts continue 
- `Phenytoin Infusion`: 15–18mg/kg IVI (roughly 1g if 60kg, and 1.5g if 80kg; max 2g) at a rate of 50mg/min (maximum rate).
- Maintenance dose: 100mg/6–8h (check levels).
- <mark> don’t put diazepam in same line: they don’t mix. </mark>
- do not use if bradycardiac or heart block.
- `Warning`: Monitor BP and ECG for potential hypotension or bradycardia.
- If ﬁts continue 
- General anesthesia (with e.g. `propofol`) and `ventilation` with continuous `EEG` monitoring in `ICU`.
- Continuous monitoring is critical, especially for respiratory function. 

> [!Note] General anesthesia
>    
> Continuing seizures after 60–90mins of above therapies require expert help with paralysis (eg propofol infusion) and ventilation with continuous EEG monitoring in ICU.
> 
> Never spend longer than 20min on someone with status epilepticus without having help at the bedside from an anaesthetist
> 

- Rule out pseudo-seizures if there are odd features (e.g., pelvic thrusts; resisting attempts to open lids and your attempts to do passive movements; arms and legs ﬂailing around).
- `Dexamethasone`: 10mg IV if vasculitis/cerebral oedema (tumour) possible.
- `After Seizures are Controlled` Start oral anticonvulsants and identify potential causes (e.g., hypoglycemia, pregnancy, alcohol, CNS infections, or inadequate anticonvulsant dosing/compliance).
