# **Encephalitis**

<mark> Suspect encephalitis whenever odd behavior, reduced consciousness, focal neurology, or seizures occur after an infectious prodrome (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, cold sores, conjunctivitis, or meningeal signs). </mark>

<mark> It is often wise to treat (see below) before the exact cause is known—usually viral, and often never identified. </mark>

If no prodrome is present, consider encephalopathy (e.g., hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, drugs, hypoxia, uremia, SLE, Wernicke's encephalopathy ( give vit B1 if in doubt ) ).

### **Investigations:**

1. **Blood tests:**
    
    - `Blood cultures`
    - Serum for `viral PCR` (also `throat swab` and `midstream urine`)
    - `Toxoplasma IgM titre`
    - `Malaria film`
2. **Imaging:**

    - `Contrast-enhanced CT`: Check for focal bilateral temporal lobe involvement (suggestive of HSV encephalitis) or meningeal enhancement (suggesting meningoencephalitis). Do before lumbar puncture (LP).
    - `MRI` is an alternative if allergic to contrast. 
3. **Lumbar Puncture (LP):**
    
    - Increased CSF protein, lymphocytes, and decreased glucose (classic signs). Send CSF for `viral PCR` (including HSV).
4. **EEG:**
    
    - Urgent EEG showing diffuse abnormalities may help confirm encephalitis but won’t identify the cause.

### **Management:**

- **Empirical Treatment:**
    
    - **Aciclovir** (10 mg/kg every 8 hours IV over 1 hour) should be started within **30 minutes** of arrival for suspected HSV encephalitis (14 days of treatment, extend to 21 days if immunosuppressed).
    - Specific therapies are available for `CMV` (combination therapy with `ganciclovir` and `foscarnet` as first line therapy) and `toxoplasmosis` (`pyrimethamine` + `sulfadiazine` + `folic acid`).
- **Supportive Therapy:**
    
    - Manage in ICU if required.
- **Symptomatic Treatment:**
    
    - Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin) for seizures. (see Status epilepticus article)
- **Prognosis:**
    
    - Untreated viral encephalitis has a mortality rate of ~70%.
