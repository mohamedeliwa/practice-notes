# Pulmonary embolism (PE)

## Investigations

- `2-level Wells’ score` for PE risk stratify.
- `Urea` & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolytes`
- `CBC`
- `Baseline clotting`
- `ECG`: commonly normal or sinus tachycardia; right ventricular strain pattern V1–V3 right axis deviation, RBBB, AF, may be deep S waves in I, Q waves in III, inverted T waves in III (‘SI QIII TIII’).
- `CXR`: often normal; decreased vascular markings, small pleural effusion Wedgeshaped area of infarction. Atelectasis.
- `ABG`: hyperventilation + poor gas exchange: PaO2, PaCO2, pH.
- `Serum D-dimer`:
  - low specificity (increases if thrombosis, inflammation, post-op, infection, malignancy), so check only in patients with low pre-test probability.
  - A -ve D-dimer in a low-probability patient effective excludes PE
- `CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)`
  - Sensitive and specific
  - The test of choice for high-risk patients or low-risk patients with a +ve D-dimer. - If unavailable, a `ventilation–perfusion (V/Q)` scan can aid diagnosis but frequently produces equivocal results

## Treatment

- If good story and signs, make the diagnosis. Start treatment before
  definitive investigations: most PE deaths occur within 1h.
- `Oxygen` if hypoxic, 10–15L/min
- `Morphine` 5–10mg IV with anti-emetic if the patient is in pain or very distressed
- IV access and start `LMWH`/`fondaparinux`
- If low BP give 500mL `IV fluid` bolus Get ICU input
- Haemodynamic instability
  - Unstable: Consider thrombolysis (eg `alteplase` 10mg IV bolus then IVI 90mg/2h)
  - Stable: If persistent low BP consider vasopressors, eg `dobutamine` 2.5–10mcg/kg min IV or `noradrenaline`; aim for systolic BP >90mmHg
- Long-term anticoagulation
  - `DOAC`: switch directly from LMWH
  - `Warfarin`: continue LMWH until INR >2
  - If obvious cause, 3 months of anticoagulation may be enough;
    otherwise, continue for ≥3–6 months (long term if recurrent emboli, or
    underlying malignancy).
  - Investigate underlying cause, eg thrombophilia, SLE, or polycythaemia
  - Consider malignancy: check CXR, CBC, LFT, Ca2+; urine alysis; consider CT abdomen/pelvis and mammogram.
