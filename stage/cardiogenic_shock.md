# Cardiogenic shock

Cardiogenic shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion primarily due to cardiac
dysfunction. It may occur suddenly, or after progressively worsening heart failure.

# Management

==If the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital==

- Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU.
## Investigations

- `ECG` 
- Urea & `Creatinine`
- `Electrolyte` 
- `Troponin` 
- `ABG`
- `CXR` 
- `Echo` 
- If indicated, `CT` thorax
	- Speak with radiologists, this can be protocolled for both `aortic dissection` and `PE` .

## Monitor

- `CVP` and an arterial line to monitor pressure
	- If these are already in place consider measuring cardiac output and volume status
- `BP`
- `ABG`
- `ECG`
	- Record a 12-lead ECG every hour until the diagnosis is made.
	- Keep on cardiac monitor.
- `Urine` output.
	- `Catheterize` for accurate urine output.

## Treatment

- `Oxygen` target arterial saturations of 94–98% (88–92% if COPD)
- `Diamorphine` 1.25–5mg IV for pain and anxiety
- `Investigations` and close `monitoring`: see above
- Correct:
	- `Arrhythmias`
	- `Urea`, `Creatinine`, & `Electrolytes` abnormalities
	- `Acid–base` disturbance
- Optimize filling pressure with clinical assessment of pulse, BP, JVP/CVP
- If `underfilled`: 
	- Give a plasma expander 100mL every 15min IV
	- Aim MAP 70mmHg, CVP 8–10mmHg
- If `well/over-filled`:
	- Inotropic support, e.g. `dobutamine` 2.5–10mcg/kg/min IVI.
	- Aim MAP 70mmHg
- Look for and treat any reversible cause
	- MI or PE : consider `thrombolysis`
	- `Surgery` for: acute VSD, mitral, or aortic incompetence



> MAP = mean arterial pressure.
> MAP = cardiac output (CO) x systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
> CO = stroke volume x heart rate.
> Shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both.
