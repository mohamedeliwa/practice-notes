# Hemorrhagic shock


## Management

<mark>If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.</mark>

## Treatment

- `Stop bleeding` if possible
- If still shocked despite 2L `crystalloid` Or present with `class III/IV shock` 
	- `Crossmatch blood` (request O Rh –ve in an emergency)
- Give `FFP` with `red cells` (1 : 1 ratio)
	- Aim for `platelets` >100 and `fibrinogen` >1 (guided by results, but e.g. 1 unit of `platelets` and 2 units of `cryoprecipitate` per 6–8 units of` red cells`). 
- Consider `tranexamic acid` 2g IV.
- Discuss with hematology early.
