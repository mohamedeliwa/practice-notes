# Heat exposure (heat exhaustion)

## Management

<mark>If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.</mark>

## Treatment

- `Lukewarm water` (not cold) to sponge or wipe the patient's body.
	-  Avoid `ice` and `cold water immersion`
- `Fanning` helps by increasing evaporation from the skin
- Resuscitate with IVI, e.g. 0.9% `saline` ± `hydrocortisone` 100mg IV
- `Lorazepam` 1–2mg IV or `chlorpromazine` 25mg IM/IV may be used to stop shivering.
- `Stop cooling` when core temperature <39°C.
