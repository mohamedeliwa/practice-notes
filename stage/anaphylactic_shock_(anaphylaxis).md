# Anaphylactic shock (Anaphylaxis)

Type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Release of histamine and other agents
causes: capillary leak; wheeze; cyanosis; oedema (larynx, lids, tongue, lips); urticaria.
More common in atopic individuals.

## Assessment 

- `ABCDE` : with shock we are dealing primarily with `C`
- 2 large-bore `IV access`
- `ECG`: for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischemia.
- General review: any features suggestive of anaphylaxis—`history`, `urticaria`, `angioedema`, `wheeze`?

==If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.==


## Immediate Management

- Secure the airway 
	- `100% O2`
	- `Intubate` if respiratory obstruction imminent
- Remove the `cause`
- `Raising the feet` may help restore the circulation
- Give `adrenaline` IM 0.5mg [^1]
	- Repeat every 5min, if needed
	- Guided by BP, pulse, and respiratory function, until better
- Secure `IV access`
- `Chlorphenamine` 10mg IV
- `Hydrocortisone` 200mg IV
- IVI (`0.9% saline`, 500mL over ¼h; up to 2L may be needed)
	- Adjust the amount of fluid based on the blood pressure.
- If wheeze, treat for asthma
	- May require `ventilatory` support
- If still hypotensive
	- admission to `ICU`
	- an IVI of `adrenaline` may be needed ± `aminophylline`
	- nebulized `salbutamol`

## Further management

- Admit to ward.
- Monitor `ECG`.
- Measure `serum tryptase` 1–6h after suspected anaphylaxis.
- Continue `chlorphenamine` 4mg/6h oral, if itching.
- Suggest wearing an `identification bracelet` that lists the specific allergen.
- Teach about` self-injected adrenaline` (0.3mg) to prevent a fatal attack.
- `Skin-prick tests` showing specific IgE help identify allergens to avoid.


> [!NOTE] [^1] Adrenaline (epinephrine)
> Is given IM and NOT IV unless the patient is severely ill, or has no pulse.
> The `IV dose` is different: 100mcg/min—titrating with the response.
>This is 0.5mL of 1 : 10 000 solution IV per minute.
>Stop as soon as a response has been obtained.
>If on a Beta-blocker, consider salbutamol IV in place of adrenaline.
