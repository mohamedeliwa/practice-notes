# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

### Characterized by

- Common progressive disorder
- Airway obstruction (`FEV₁ <80% predicted; FEV₁/FVC <0.7;`)
- Little or no reversibility.
- Includes `chronic bronchitis` and `emphysema`

Usually patients have either COPD or asthma, not both

### COPD is favoured over asthma by:

- Age of onset >35yrs
- Smoking (passive or active) or pollution related
- Chronic dyspnoea
- Sputum production
- Minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV₁ variation.

### Chronic bronchitis

Deﬁned clinically as cough, sputum production on most days for `3 months of 2 successive yrs`

- Symptoms improve if they stop smoking
- There is no excess mortality if lung function is normal.

### Emphysema

Deﬁned histologically as enlarged air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT.

### Pink puffers:

Have ↑ alveolar ventilation, a near `normal PₐO₂` and a `normal or low PₐCO₂`. They are `breathless` but are `not cyanosed`. They may progress to `type I respiratory failure`

### Blue bloaters:

Have ↓ alveolar ventilation, with a `low PₐO₂` and a `high PₐCO₂`. They are `cyanosed` but `not breathless` and may go on to develop `cor-pulmonale`. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO₂ and they rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory effort — supplemental oxygen should be given with care.

### The most common bacterial organisms that cause infective exacerbations of COPD are:

- Haemophilus influenzae (most common cause)
- Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Moraxella catarrhalis

Respiratory viruses account for around 30% of exacerbations, with the human rhinovirus being the most important pathogen

### Investigations

- CBC: ↑ RBCs.
- CXR: Hyperinﬂation (>7 posterior ribs); ﬂat hemidiaphragms; large central pulmonary arteries; ↓ peripheral vascular markings (black lung sign); bullae.
- CT: Bronchial wall thickening; scarring; air space enlargement.
- ECG: Right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale).
- echo : if features of core pulmonale.
- ABG: ↓ PₐO₂ ± hypercapnia.
- Spirometry: obstructive + air trapping (FEV₁ <80% of predicted, FEV₁:FVC ratio <70% post-​bronchodilation, ↑ TLC, ↑ RV, ↓ DLCO in emphysema).
- Thyroid function test (TFT): if unduly breathless
- α1-​AT levels: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic cause of early-onset emphysema (basal emphysema). and is worse in smokers and can cause COPD at a young age (40s and 50s).

### CXR

The following are Chest x-rays demonstrates very marked hyperinflation of both lungs. Over 11 posterior ribs are seen, the diaphragms are flattened and there is enlargement of the retrosternal airspace. Pulmonary vasculature not terribly distorted, although there is some prominence of the pulmonary arteries.
