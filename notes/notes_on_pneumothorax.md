# Pneumothorax

### Symptoms

- Asymptomatic
- Sudden onset of `dyspnea` and/or `pleuritic` chest pain
- Asthma or COPD patients may present with a sudden deterioration
- Mechanically ventilated patients can `suddenly develop hypoxia` or an increase in `ventilation pressures`.

### X-rays

- `Should not` be performed if a tension pneumothorax
- Request an expiratory ﬁlm
- Look for an area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to the edge of the collapsed
  lung
- Ensure the suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous
  bulla

This is a great educational image from ICU. The inexperienced doctor could be distracted by the poor quality image, missing the lung bases:

Technicians do their best under difﬁcult conditions. To ask for a new CXR here would be a mistake.

Note the large right-sided tension pneumothorax needing immediate decompression!.  
**Lungs**: The right lung ﬁeld is too black compared to the left, the right hemidiaphragm is depressed, and the right lung is seen collapsed against the mediastinum.  
**Mediastinum**: Left-shifted, obstructing venous return—so ↓cardiac output, and a threat to life.  
**Is it being pushed or pulled?** Check hila, bones, and soft tissues. Since the right lung is collapsed and mediastinum shifted to left this suggests right tension pneumothorax. Needle thoracocentesis decompression and a chest drain are needed now.

Large right-sided pneumothorax; note the trachea remains central, suggesting this is a simple pneumothorax, not a tension pneumothorax.
