# CURB 65 score

CURB 65 is an evidence based tool used to risk stratify patients presenting with pneumonia.

| Criterion                                                      | Marker |

| urea > 7 mmol/L                                                | 1      |
| Respiration rate >= 30/min                                     | 1      |
| Blood pressure: systolic <= 90 mmHg and/or diastolic <= 60mmHg | 1      |
| Aged >= 65 years                                               | 1      |
