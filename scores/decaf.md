# DECAF Score

Can be used to predict mortality from COPD exacerbations. A commonly used score is the DECAF (Dyspnoea, Eosinopenia, Consolidation, Acidaemia, and atrial Fibrillation).

A score of 0 conveys an inpatient `mortality of <1%` compared to score of 5, which had an inpatient `mortality of 70%`. A score of ≤1 can be used to help decide which patients are suitable for outpatient treatment.
